UK GAAP Tuples Notes started 07.11.11
====================
Doc/BrosAndTx/TuplesNotes.txt

Tuples do not appear in Definition trees, only Presentation ones. That is what caused me not to give them much attention
previously, following the advice of the good book which said that the definition trees were what mattered.

There is actually quite a lot to them.

  The declaration of tuple container elements

  4.7 Nesting Mark-up
  Re One visible descr for two tuples, one for this year, one for the comparatives.

  4.8 Tuple Member Ordering
  The Inline XBRL Specification deliberately avoids the need for conformant processors to be Taxonomy‐aware. As a consequence,
  an Inline XBRL processor is not aware of the constraints of the content model of a Taxonomy tuple definition. It is therefore
  up to thecreator of the Inline XBRL mark‐up to explicitly provide information about the order inwhich tuple members are to
  appear in the target XBRL instance document (the order of tuples themselves and other primary items is, of course, irrelevant).

  The ‘order’ attribute exists to carry this information and it can take any decimal value. The output order of tuple members is
  imposed by the natural ordering relation defined by decimal values of increasing magnitude - it is not necessary for the values
  to be consecutive integers. This allows an application to assign static order values to each member of a tuple, corresponding
  with the order defined by the ComplexType definitionin a Taxonomy, regardless of whether every tuple member appears in the output.

  The fractional part of the decimal value can be used to represent the order of members in a tuple nested inside another tuple.
  For example, if a tuple were the 4th child member of an enclosing tuple its member content could be ordered thus: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, etc
  – in terms of the sub‐tuple the constant integer part is irrelevant; the ordering of members is defined by the fractional part.

  . 3.5 Tuples
    Tuples are used to group tags ....

    A special case of tuples is those which contain only one tag.  An example is the tuple ‘Accounting policy changes [grouping]’
    which contains only the tag ‘Description of change in accounting policy and its impact’.  The purpose of containing this tag
    within a tuple is to allow it to be used multiple times in a report to tag different descriptions of changes in accounting policies.

  . 4.9 Repetition of tags within tuples
    RULE:  Tags within tuples may be used multiple times for the same context within an XBRL report, but in this case they must be
    reported in different occurrences of the tuple.

    This rule reflects the normal functionality of tuples.

  . 7.5 Other technical features
    4.  Tuples in the accounts taxonomies generally do not impose significant rules on the minimum / maximum occurrences of elements.
    However, a few tuples do impose such cardinality rules.  Software should accurately implement these rules.

Braiins DB
----------
Tuples DB info is held in the Tuples table and via Elements and Arcs.

View Tuples via Elements List and SubstGroupN = 2
and the Tuples List report via Utils Menu

Basic Info
----------
Number of Tuples:                    158
Number of Tuple/Tx Elements pairs:   524 (number of rows in the Tuples table)
Number of unique Tx Element members: 506 (9 members appear in multiple tuples a total of 27 times = 18 fewer unique pairs)

Elements that are Members of Multiple Tuples [See also "Narrowing Scope of Elements that are Members of Multiple Tuples" later on.]
--------------------------------------------
There are 9 of them: 1324, 1448, 1563, 1608, 3237, 3382 (Share), 3878, 4617, 5186 (Money). Others with no (Type) are String
See also the "Other Tuples also Member Of" column of Tuples List.

One of these, 5186, which has 3 possible tuples, is used with Officers.
See List Bros for Officers% with the Tuples column turned on.
Or do a Bros Lookup for Tx Id = 5186.
Or an Elements Lookup for 5186.

27 Tuple/Member pairs are involved.

Tuple Members used twice with same Tuple in Presentation Trees
--------------------------------------------------------------
There are 9 such tuple members:  196,  213, 1393, 1489, 1506, 3281, 5121, 5230, 5234
                        Tuple = 3530, 3680, 3530, 3551, 3680, 3551, 5269, 5164, 5165
5121, 5230, and 5234 are for Period Start/Period End cases. The others involve different presentation trees and/or hypercubes.

None of these is used in multiple tuples.

Re Some Section 13 "Groupings / tuples – further information" Points (Re minOccurs and maxOccurs)
====================================================================
There are only three minOccurs and maxOccurs combinations in use:
Optional once      0,1               O
Mandatory once     1,1               M
Optional Unbounded 1,255 unbounded   U

Section says in part:
--------------------
The cardinality of most tags in tuples is set to min 0 and max 1.

The number of Tuple/Member pairs where this is true is 478.

Select TupTxId,ElId,Text From TuplePairs T Join Elements E on E.Id= T.ElId Join Text X on X.Id=E.StdLabelTxtId Where minOccurs=0 and maxOccurs = 1 order by ElId

Section says in part:
--------------------
However, a small number of tags in certain tuples have cardinality of min 1 and max 1, so that they must be used if the tuple is used.
(This mainly applies to descriptive tags which are essential to the meaning of the data concerned.)

The number is 18.

Section says in part:
--------------------
In a few tuples, the cardinality of a tag is set to max unbounded, so that it can be used an unlimited number of times in a tuple occurrence.

The number is 28. All have minOccurs=0

Select TupTxId,ElId,Text From TuplePairs T Join Elements E on E.Id= T.ElId Join Text X on X.Id=E.StdLabelTxtId Where maxOccurs > 1 order by ElId

5165   5234   Number of specific options, directors
5464   5369   Code for activity

Section says in part
--------------------
Note that the cardinality of a tag is defined individually in each tuple – if a tag is used in several tuples,
it can have different cardinality in each tuple.

Select * From TuplePairs where ElId in (Select ElId From TuplePairs group by ElId having count(*) > 1) order by ElId desc
-> 27 results
All have minOccurs=0 and maxOccurs=1

So, "can have different cardinality in each tuple" but don't in UK-GAAP.


Narrowing Scope of Elements that are Members of Multiple Tuples
===============================================================
Can the scope (where use allowed) of the 9 elements which are members of multiple tuples

Tuple References and DB Storage
===============================
<ix:tuple tag in iXBRL head section
  one per tuple used : per specific instance : per period
  e.g. from TH sample:                                                                            <------> Braiins tupleID
  <ix:tuple name="uk-gaap:SpecificTypeEquityAssetHeldInPensionSchemeGrouping" tupleID="tuple.101" T.1.1.Y0 /> Instance = European equities, Period = 2008
  <ix:tuple name="uk-gaap:SpecificTypeEquityAssetHeldInPensionSchemeGrouping" tupleID="tuple.102" T.1.1.Y1 /> Instance = European equities, Period = 2007
  <ix:tuple name="uk-gaap:SpecificTypeEquityAssetHeldInPensionSchemeGrouping" tupleID="tuple.103" T.1.2.Y0 /> Instance = Other equities, Period = 2008
  <ix:tuple name="uk-gaap:SpecificTypeEquityAssetHeldInPensionSchemeGrouping" tupleID="tuple.104" T.1.2.Y1 /> Instance = Other equities, Period = 2007

  Braiins convention for the tupleId: T.n.i.Y#
  where n  = running number for tuples in the FS - same for tuples with same name /- same for diff years
        i  = instance number                                                      |
        Y# = Y and year digit as used in contexts

tupleRef='the tupleId' and 'order='x' in the tag e.g. from TH sample
  <ix:nonNumeric name="uk-gaap:DescriptionTypeEquityAssetHeldInPensionScheme" order="1" tupleRef="tuple.101" contextRef="Period_TMinusZero">European equities</ix:nonNumeric>

Though could use this form (from ddddd) as now used in header for the Author Tuple:

<ix:tuple name='uk-bus:XBRLDocumentAuthorGrouping' tupleID='AuthorTuple'>
  <ix:nonNumeric name='uk-bus:NameAuthor' contextRef='PeriodY0' order='1'>$v</ix:nonNumeric>
  <ix:nonNumeric name='uk-bus:DescriptionOrTitleAuthor' contextRef='PeriodY0' order='2'>Braiins Limited</ix:nonNumeric>
  <ix:nonNumeric name='uk-bus:PrincipleDocumentAuthor' contextRef='PeriodY0' order='3'>true</ix:nonNumeric>
</ix:tuple>

Need to record
- normal BroRef which -> BroId which -> TxId which = MemTxId of the tuple but that is not unique so also need the tuple ref
- tuple ref = TxId of tuple or tuple # (Id)
- tuple instance code = running #
- the value

RG would need to know of tuple to include it in the BroRef.
RG will need to be able to loop for instances.


Questions
=========
- Is it necessary to nest Descr as below from the Style Guide Section 4.7 Nesting Mark-up?
  TH's example does not do this.

<td><ix:nonNumeric name=”DescLine” contextref=”CY” tupleref=”t1” order=”1”>
    <ix:nonNumeric name=”DescLine” contextref=”PY” tupleref=”t2” order=”1”>
