Looking for OWL info showed up another OWL http://www.doxbox.ca/ which has an impressive list of features, and is open source written in PHP!
Despite all the features, this OWL does not seem to be getting much TLC though. Perhaps it could be useful for us. I haven't downloaded it yet, but will at some point.


Get rid of $.browser use and jquery-migrate-1.0.0.js extract for it in BDT.js

Alternative from SlickGrid channel:
I just extended jQuery with the code below; although it does not directly answer your question it will definitely fix the problem with as few lines of code as possible. 
jQuery.browser = {};
jQuery.browser.mozilla = /mozilla/.test(navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase()) && !/webkit/.test(navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase());
jQuery.browser.webkit = /webkit/.test(navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase());
jQuery.browser.opera = /opera/.test(navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase());
jQuery.browser.msie = /msie/.test(navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase());


Check for jui 1.11 re Alert jwindow masking problem.
Follow through on other jui 1.10 point in Bdt.js

On DataImport ensure Year dates are set. (Used by EL, ER, ED.)

Check the various zIndex values for possible interaction incl the sg ones and 999999 formask in Busy()

use sscanf more.

Server Side
===========
          1. Take error handling back to the pre Mosso method via an Exec call of Error.cli

          2. Complete Sessions items:
11.01.12     - Allow for multiple windows/tabs with info kept separate.
11.01.12     - Tentative downgrade after xx wo access. Made to work for new window via sessionStorage and localStorage
             - Ip, IpN, and UserAgent update in Visits if different on a subsequent visit, as per NMS.php
             - Detect bots as per NMS.php

             - Add EoD or other compaction of UserAgent and referrer fields

02.01.12  3. Change password encoding to SHA2. http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/encryption-functions.html#function_sha2
             Or use the PHP fn sha1() of hash() instead of the MySQL one so saving a DB query just to do this e.g. when saving the pw in Reg.php.
             But why is strong encryption an issue as any login attempt will go through the right hashing? Only relevent if DB table has been stolen?
             Action taken 02.01.12:
               Changed to use of SHA512 password encryption via hash() with salt based on Id, done in fn GenPw($pw, $id) added to FuncsDB.inc
               Added count of falied attempts and lock person out if....
               Removed security question from Registraion. Not relevent. Administrator to reset passwords.

          4. Write cron tasks as per"Cron or EoD Task" section.

30.12.11  5. For Headings add update of the AgentData ADT_Headings record
             ==> or switch to doing everything via the AgentData ADT_Headings record and drop the Headings table

07.04.11  6. Change DBLogging to record only the new not both old and new

          7. Locking re multi-user posting

          8. Site maintenance "lock"

          9. Archive DBLog and Visit related tables

         10. Write php module compacter for compiled formats. And for own modules? Use a php compiler?

         11. ignore_user_abort() use needed? See http://php.net/manual/en/features.connection-handling.php

DBs
