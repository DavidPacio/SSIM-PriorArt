- Define the BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors children (not grand children) i.e. Bros 4-6 (Tx 237 - 3039) above as Subtotal type (not 7 string type)
  = Report Only (no posting, so must post to next level), and can be Sum To targets

- 'Sum To' for Bro  9 = Bro 4 (Trade Debtors due after one year  -> Trade debtors)
- 'Sum To' for Bro 14 = Bro 4 (Trade Debtors due within one year -> Trade debtors)

- 'Sum To' for Bro 10 = Bro 5 (Group due after one year  -> Group)
- 'Sum To' for Bro 15 = Bro 5 (Group due within one year -> Group)

etc

Gives:
Sum of all Debtors in Bro 3
Sum of Trade (under + over year) in Bro 4
Sum of Group (under + over year) in Bro 5
etc
Sum of Debtors due after one year  in Bro 8
Sum of Debtors due within one year in Bro 13

Method 2
--------
Using sets per debtor type:

1   Set BS.NetAssets                                                  3261
2   Set   BS.NetAssets.Current                                        3277
3   Set     BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors                              1202
4   Set       BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Trade                      4834 <- Trade Debtors 4834
5   Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Trade.DueAfterOneYear    4835 <- Trade Debtors due after one year 4835
6   Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Trade.DueWithinOneYear   4836 <- Trade Debtors due within one year 4836
7   Set       BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Group                       237
8   Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Group.DueAfterOneYear     238
9   Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Group.DueWithinOneYear    239
10  Ele       ...
11  Set       BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Comment                    1209
12  Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Comment.DueAfterOneYear  1206
13  Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Comment.DueWithinOneYear 1208
14  Ele       BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.DueAfterOneYear            1205
15  Ele       BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.DueWithinOneYear           1207

- Define Bros 14 and 15 4-6 above as Subtotal type
  = Report Only (no posting), and can be Sum To targets

- 'Sum To' for Bro 5 = Bro 14 (Trade Debtors due after one year  -> Debtors due after one year)
- 'Sum To' for Bro 6 = Bro 15 (Trade Debtors due within one year -> Debtors due within one year)

- 'Sum To' for Bro 8 = Bro 14 (Group due after one year  -> Debtors due after one year)
- 'Sum To' for Bro 9 = Bro 15 (Group due within one year -> Debtors due within one year)

etc

Gives:
Sum of all Debtors in Bro 3
Sum of Trade (under + over year) in Bro 4
Sum of Group (under + over year) in Bro 7
etc
Sum of Debtors due after one year  in Bro 14
Sum of Debtors due within one year in Bro 15

14 and 15 would not Sum Up to 3 as 'Sum To' ops are performed after set summing.
Though to make it clear that this is not happening and not wanted, 'Sum Up' could be set to 'No.
Or 14 and 15 could be made Total type rather than Subtotal type.


--------

Either should work but I prefer Method 2 as the summing is clearer with only 2 subtotal Bros vs 19 or so in Method 1.

Method 3
--------
Using multi-index sets:

1   Set BS.NetAssets                                                  3261
2   Set   BS.NetAssets.Current                                        3277
3   Set     BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[]                            1202
4   Set       BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Trade                      4834 <- Trade Debtors 4834
5   Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[AfterOneYear].Trade.DueAfterOneYear    4835 <- Trade Debtors due after one year 4835
6   Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[WithinOneYear].Trade.DueWithinOneYear  4836 <- Trade Debtors due within one year 4836
7   Set       BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Group                       237
8   Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[AfterOneYear].Group.DueAfterOneYear     238
9   Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[WithinOneYear].Group.DueWithinOneYear   239
10  Ele       ...
11  Set       BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Comment                    1209
12  Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Comment.DueAfterOneYear  1206 Without index as string so no summing involved.
13  Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Comment.DueWithinOneYear 1208 "

- No Subtotal types or 'Sum To's needed. (But programming required.)

- The empty []s at the end of Bro 3's name BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors say this is a Set which can have extra indices.
  (Corresponding to a multi-dimensioned array in programming terms, but I would avoid use of the word dimension in regard
  to sets like this given its XBRL use.)
  Any number of indices could be used. Just 2 here for AfterOneYear and WithinOneYear
  The indices could be any word or number.

  It would not actually be necessary to use the empty []s with 3 i.e. just the use of the indices with Bros 5, 6, etc would
  be enough to trigger that Set BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors has indices but perhaps it would be good to adopt the empty []s
  convention for clairty and checking purposes.

- 5, 6, 8, 9 etc then use an extra index to effectively specify an extra level of summing.

Effetively the indices with BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors replace the separate subtotal Bros
14 Ele BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.DueAfterOneYear
15 Ele BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.DueWithinOneYear

Gives:
Sum of all Debtors                 in Bro 3 referenced as BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors i.e. without index
Sum of Debtors due after one year  in Bro 3 referenced as BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[AfterOneYear]
Sum of Debtors due within one year in Bro 3 referenced as BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[WithinOneYear]
Sum of Trade (under + over year) in Bro 4
Sum of Group (under + over year) in Bro 7

The elements could be referenced as
BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[AfterOneYear].Trade.DueAfterOneYear
or
BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Trade.DueAfterOneYear
as the [AfterOneYear] is not part of the element address. It specifies summing.

Method 4
--------
As per 3 but using numeric indices:

1   Set BS.NetAssets                                                   3261
2   Set   BS.NetAssets.Current                                         3277
3   Set     BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[]                             1202
4   Set       BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Trade                       4834 <- Trade Debtors 4834
5   Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[1].Trade.DueAfterOneYear  4835 <- Trade Debtors due after one year 4835
6   Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[2].Trade.DueWithinOneYear 4836 <- Trade Debtors due within one year 4836
7   Set       BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Group                        237
8   Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[1].Group.DueAfterOneYear   238
9   Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[2].Group.DueWithinOneYear  239
10  Ele       ...
11  Set       BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Comment                     1209
12  Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Comment.DueAfterOneYear   1206 Without index as string so no summing involved.
13  Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Comment.DueWithinOneYear  1208 "

Gives:
Sum of all Debtors                 in Bro 3 referenced as BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors i.e. without index
Sum of Debtors due after one year  in Bro 3 referenced as BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[1]
Sum of Debtors due within one year in Bro 3 referenced as BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[2]
Sum of Trade (under + over year) in Bro 4
Sum of Group (under + over year) in Bro 7

Shorter, but then you need to remember what 1 and 2 mean.

Method 5
--------
Using multi-index sets as per 3 but using 'Sum To' to specify which index is to be summed to:

1   Set BS.NetAssets                                                  3261
2   Set   BS.NetAssets.Current                                        3277
3   Set     BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[]                            1202
4   Set       BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Trade                      4834 <- Trade Debtors 4834
5   Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Trade.DueAfterOneYear    4835 <- Trade Debtors due after one year 4835
6   Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Trade.DueWithinOneYear   4836 <- Trade Debtors due within one year 4836
7   Set       BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Group                       237
8   Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Group.DueAfterOneYear     238
9   Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Group.DueWithinOneYear    239
10  Ele       ...
11  Set       BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Comment                    1209
12  Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Comment.DueAfterOneYear  1206
13  Ele         BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors.Comment.DueWithinOneYear 1208

with 'Sum To's of:
- 'Sum To' for Bro 5 = BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[AfterOneYear]
- 'Sum To' for Bro 6 = BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[WithinOneYear]
- 'Sum To' for Bro 8 = BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[AfterOneYear]
- 'Sum To' for Bro 9 = BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[WithinOneYear]
etc
or, for numeric indices:
- 'Sum To' for Bro 5 = BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[1]
- 'Sum To' for Bro 6 = BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[2]
- 'Sum To' for Bro 8 = BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[1]
- 'Sum To' for Bro 9 = BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[2]


Gives same result as methods 3 and 4 i.e.:
Sum of all Debtors                 in Bro 3 referenced as BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors i.e. without index
Sum of Debtors due after one year  in Bro 3 referenced as BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[AfterOneYear]
Sum of Debtors due within one year in Bro 3 referenced as BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[WithinOneYear]
Sum of Trade (under + over year) in Bro 4
Sum of Group (under + over year) in Bro 7
or, for numeric indices
Sum of Debtors due after one year  in Bro 3 referenced as BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[1]
Sum of Debtors due within one year in Bro 3 referenced as BS.NetAssets.Current.Debtors[2]
