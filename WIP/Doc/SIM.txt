to I StartEnd column of Export

Make 'Agent' a user choice word re corporates

Bro Doc

  •  Created
  •  Edited
  •  Converted to client status

  People

Questions
---------
Allow some Property Object Members to be used in accounting posting BroRefs e.g.

PublicRelations
  InvestorRelations
  MediaRelations
SalesMarketing
  Sales
  Marketing

Any properties for Quasi?

SIC 12 Special purpose entities

To Decide
---------
How to handle Tuples

We will need some mechanism in In-BroSets to handle different instances of the same BroRef where that is appropriate e.g. donations to political parties A, B, C, where that 'mechanism' gets mapped to tuples and tuple instances in the Tx area.

This will be an example of where 'properties all the way' will work well, I think.

We could perhaps have a Property called Instances whose Members are dynamic and = the instance# or reference entered in posting.

Once we allow for dynamic Property Members we could use them for other things too e.g. Director "instances" and so remove arbitrary limits like the 40 Directors in UK-GAAP. Though we would still need to cope with such limits when mapping BRL Properties to Taxonomy Dimensions.

To be thought about...

Points/Questions to Charles

- Group -> 1
  Why needed at all?

- Consol as an example of Ei reduction
  No 'Other'

- 27 Subsids - quasi

- K unque not within type

- What does 'of this type' mean re PensionSchemes?
