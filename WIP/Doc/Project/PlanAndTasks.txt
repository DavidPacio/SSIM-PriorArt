  . Desktop (Minimise all open windows to bottom bar)

Operations performed in resizeable, dragable windows, that can be maximised, standardised (set back to opening size),
and minimised to the task bar, with tabs for the various options:

- Accounts (produce Accounts)
  . Set current year for accounts [access controlled by permissions]
    This is when the credits are decremented, other than for demo entities,
    not at upload data time in case someone does everything via edit.
    Need to do a balance forward? Depends on whether we upload all years every year or just the current year. Not initially anyway.
  . Upload data from export format run by user by copy/paste to a text box
    . check if anything missing?
  . Edit data in second lvel of tabs for each section with grids incl tagging if/where nec
  . Generate Accounts with format selection option when we have multiple formats
    Output to another tab, or possibly to a separate window just for showing accounts
  . Reports
    . Audit Tagging Report -> on screen view, with option to produce a pdf
    . Entity (Client) Tagging Report -> on screen view, with option to produce a pdf
  . Download Accpunts as an iXBRL file + optionally one or both of the tagging reports

- Entity [access controlled by permissions]
  . Add/Edit/Reset/Delete
    Reset = back to initial data load for a real entity, back to initial state for demo entities
  . Report tab
    . Entities with stats

- Messages system
  . To Braiins
  . From Braiins
  . To other Staff?

- Preferences [access controlled by permissions]
  . Headings
    . Master headings by entity type
  . Layout stuff such as font choices, colours, page numbering etc
  . More, lots more, in time

- Support
  . Open source ticket system which may require a separate url.
    Or possibly better and perhaps even easier would be to roll our own using the message system to work within the desktop?
