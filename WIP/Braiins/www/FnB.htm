<h2>The Benefits of TARI<span class=s>&reg;</span></h2>

<img class='fr imgr' src=img/PeakPerformance.jpg width=275 height=1230 alt='TARI for Peak Performance' style=margin-top:0>

<table class=mb10>
<tr><td><h4>&bull; Increased Profit</h4>
</td><td>TARI (Target Average Rate Index) is a benchmark focused on the "key driver" (key activity of the business). TARI provides the focus and the means of tracking the bottom-line impact of all business transactions.<br><br>
Thus TARI painlessly and dynamically improves the bottom line profit.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><h4>&bull; Cash Saved</h4>
</td><td>TARI stops the seepage of cash resulting from unprofitable transactions.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><h4>&bull;&nbsp;Competitive&nbsp;Advantage</h4>
</td><td>TARI provides a clear advantage over competitors. Being immediately aware of the impact on the targeted bottom line of every quote or invoice or transaction, gives the business a competitive edge.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><h4>&bull; Affordable</h4>
</td><td>TARI costs just US$27.75 per month by <a href=Reg.htm title='Subscribe to TARI'>subscription</a>.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><h4>&bull; Applicable to All</h4>
</td><td>TARI applies to all business types (service, retail, wholesale, manufacturing, trades, professional) and all sizes from small to medium to large. If the business sells something - anything - then TARI can help.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><h4>&bull; Improved Productivity</h4>
</td><td>Despite everyone being busy and stressed, a typical business is only 64% or so productive i.e. 5 hours output for 8 hours pay. Because it is not possible to improve on the unknown, by identifying actual productivity, TARI starts the process of increasing it. Getting the productivity up to 75%, or just 6 hours output in an 8 hour day, can make a dramatic difference, the difference between dying and thriving.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><h4>&bull; Increased Output</h4>
</td><td>Improved productivity achieved as a result of TARI means increased output with the same resources. The value of the extra output, less any materials cost, is pure additional profit.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><h4>&bull; Reduced Stress</h4>
</td><td>By immediately identifying the impact on the bottom line of various options, TARI takes the stress out of decision-making, making it obvious which option out of several will be better.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><h4>&bull; Better Pricing</h4>
</td><td>TARI takes the guesswork out of pricing quotes, products, or services.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><h4>&bull; Better Planning</h4>
</td><td>TARI gives clear direction about the optimal pricing and volume of products and/or services.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><h4>&bull; Immediacy</h4>
</td><td>TARI provides immediate feedback of results compared with target.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><h4>&bull; Clarity</h4>
</td><td>TARI provides clarity by allowing a woods-eye view of overall performance at all times. (The details that so often get in the way remain in the background.)
</td></tr>

<tr><td><h4>&bull; Simplicity</h4>
</td><td>TARI is easily understood and applied by employees.<br><br>
The Pulse of the business can be identified at a glance.<br><br>
Business owners, managers, and employees, including people without accounting or management qualifications, can apply TARI themselves, and see their business transformed. However, for those who would rather contract out the task, or who feel they do need help, advisors at various levels can be found via <a href=http://www.tarinetwork.com/ title='TARI Network for TARI Contacts'>TARI Network</a>.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><h4>&bull; Quick Results</h4>
</td><td>You can start benefiting from TARI as quickly as 20 minutes from now. You can prove this yourself by taking a test drive of TARI using the free <a href='BS/BS.htm' title='Free Test Drive of TARI via the TARI Business Simulator'>TARI Business Simulator</a>. (TARI for Business does everything that the Business Simulator does plus automate the follow-up that makes the difference day by day.)<br><br>Any data you enter into the Simulator can be transferred to TARI for Business following subscription.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><h4>&bull; Motivation</h4>
</td><td>TARI infuses new life into people by encouraging a sense of purpose and an understanding of how each individual's contribution impacts the business.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><h4>&bull; Continuous &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improvement Culture</h4>
</td><td>TARI encourages a culture of continuous improvement as management and staff become increasingly aware of ways and means of improving business performance in real time.

<h2 class=mtn>How TARI for Business Delivers the Benefits of TARI<span class=s>&reg;</span></h2>

<p><b>TARI for Business</b> is a 21 MB downloadable program for Windows PCs, available by <a href=Reg.htm title='Subscribe to TARI'>subscription</a> at US$27.75 pm, which has been designed and developed to make it easy for you to put TARI<span class=s>&reg;</span> to work in your business, and so gain all the above TARI<span class=s>&reg;</span> Benefits.</p>

<p class=f10>For non Windows PC users, the options are to use a Windows emulator, or to use remote desktop software to access TARI for Business running on a Windows PC or Windows Server.</p>

<a name=nutshell></a><h3>In a Nutshell</h3>
<p>All that is required to get started with TARI for Business is an estimate of expenses for the period ahead together with a target net profit. If past information is available, such as sales, gross profit and expenses, staff numbers together with a representative sample of  6 invoices, it will enable an immediate &lsquo;fix&rsquo; on where the business is &lsquo;at&rsquo; and where it is possible to go given the available resources.</p>

<p>In just 20 minutes, you can input that information, run "What If" targeting to obtain your "TARI" (the target index for your key activity). The TARI for Business Help includes a special 'Quick Start' section to guide you through the steps. (It is even easier if you have used the <a href='BS/BS.htm' title='Free Test Drive of TARI via the TARI Business Simulator'>TARI Business Simulator</a>, as the data from the Simulator can be transferred to TARI for Business.)</p>

<p>That 20 minute input sets your "GPS" permitting the TARI for Business software to guide you to the desired bottom line, nudging you back on track, day by day. The result is the step by step transformation of your business.</p>

<p>Only 3 figures are required each day or week to drive a very powerful feedback report known as the Key Indicator Report.</p>

<h2 class=mtn>General Features and Benefits of TARI for Business</h2>

<p>Before getting into the specifics of the individual components of TARI for Business this table lists the general ones that apply throughout the software.</p>

<table class=mb11>
<tr><td><h4>Feature</h4>
</td><td><h4>Benefit</h4>
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Overall Picture Philosophy</b>
</td><td>TARI for Business is about the overall picture, the wood, not the trees. TARI for Business will give you useful results from the information you have available, without pestering you with the trivia.<br><br>
Management becomes focused on the two keys of physical activity and financial contribution that lie at the core of any business or department of a business.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Forgiving</b>
</td><td>In accord with the above philosophy, TARI for Business is forgiving by design. There is no accounting type worrying about a few missing cents here.<br><br>
Nothing is set in concrete. Targets can be adjusted as daily or weekly feedback comes to hand. No waitying for monthly financials delivering historical results. Changes can be effected without fuss or time-absorbing analysis.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Fast Start</b>
</td><td>You can get started with TARI for Business easily, and have your first useful result in only 20 minutes. See "<a href='#nutshell'>In a Nutshell</a>" above.<br><br>As the "Forgiving" feature above explains, it doesn't matter one bit if the first try isn't "perfect". It is always possible to adjust or revise things later as you get into the swing of the TARI way.</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Flexible Time Periods</b>
</td><td>All targeting and tracking data can be seen "daily", "weekly", "fortnightly", "4 week monthly", "calendar monthly", "quarterly", "six monthly", or "annually", regardless of how the data is entered, and without locking you into any particular inflexible time periods that have to be set up beforehand.<br><br>
Different time periods can be used for different types of transactions, and TARI for Business automatically mixes and matches as needed. For example, daily or weekly is best for invoice (sales) tracking, but monthly is just fine for expenses.<br><br>
Dates specifying when a period starts and ends can be changed at any time during use.<br><br>
It is possible to target ahead for any number of periods, even say 20 years if required. (Or 300 years if you are Japanese or Google!)<br><br>
Most accounting and planning systems force you to use fixed time periods, which are difficult to change after you get started. Not with TARI for Business, where Time Periods are truly "no hassle".
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Easy Driving</b>
</td><td>As well as being flexible about time periods, and forgiving in general, TARI for Business makes things easy in other ways:
<ul class=mb0>
<li>Only a few accounts are needed as TARI for Business deals with generating income rather than tracking every expense transaction. That's for your accounting software. TARI for Business looks at how you generate profit and control productivity.</li>
<li>When needing to reference an "account" it can be done by simply putting an amount in a field. No account numbers are required.</li>
<li>Target and expense values can be entered using the mouse. Values can be easily changed by moving the mouse. This makes budgeting  for the 12 months ahead a breeze!</li>
<li>Backup of the database is built in.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Activity Mixture No Problem</b>
</td><td>TARI for Business can handle any number of different activity types within the one business, whether organized formally via "Departments" or just separated conceptually as "Revenue Groups". If the business has just one main activity e.g. a restaurant or a plastic injection molder, that is fine. But if the business has two or more different activities e.g. a gas station with a workshop and a convenience store, then TARI for Business can handle that too. Reports can consolidate (combine) Departments/"Revenue Groups", or not, as required.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Automatic&nbsp;Calculations</b>
</td><td>Unlike with spreadsheets, TARI for Business is ready to go with reliable calculations into and out of each field. Spreadsheets can be input only or a formula (result) never both. TARI software can handle both in one field, simplifying the screens and allowing change in a predictable manner.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Help Everywhere</b>
</td><td>Specific help is available everywhere by pressing the "F1" key. In addition, the Help system provides detailed step by step guidance for common tasks, including for a 20 minute 'Quick Start'. Simply follow the steps to set up targets, track actuals, and report on progress.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>International</b>
</td><td>Date formats and the currency symbol used throughout TARI for Business are "International" in that these are picked up from computer settings during installation, though they can be changed, even on a Department by Department basis.<br><br>
If the name of a key activity is different for Metric and non-Metric countries, then the different or appropriate words can be entered e.g. "Ton Miles" for a US trucking company, and "Tonne Kilometers" for a European or Australian one.<br><br>
As to language, TARI for Business uses US English.
</td></tr>

<p class='mtn mb0'>Now to more details of the TARI for Business components:</p>

<div class='fl mtni'>
  <img id=T3 class='imgl TNail' src=img/TB-Department_Setup.jpg width=200 height=169 alt='Department Setup'>
  <p class='b c'>Department Setup</p>
</div>

<h2 class=mtn>Setup, Department or Revenue Group (Business Structure)</h2>

<p>TARI for Business uses "Departments" or "Revenue Groups" to handle different key activities within a business. This is where the "Departments" or "Revenue Groups" are defined, and edited.</p>

<table class=mb11>
<tr><td><h4>Feature</h4>
</td><td><h4>Benefit</h4>
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Departments/Revenue Groups</b>
</td><td>A business can be divided into sections (Departments/Revenue Groups) so that the appropriate activity or key driver is being tracked for each part of the business. (Each department has its own key activity or driver).<br><br>
Common activities are "Number of Hours Billed" or just "Hours", "Number of Sales" or just "Sales", "Ton Miles/Tonne Kilometers", "Gallons/Liters" and so on. It is possible to change and/or define industry specific activities if required.<br><br>
For a gas station with a workshop and a convenience store, fuel sales would use "Gallons/Liters", the workshop would use "Hours", and the convenience store would use "Sales".<br><br>
Each department can also have its own periods. Targeting and tracking is done by Department.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Separate or Consolidated Reporting</b>
</td><td>Reports can consolidate (combine) departments, or show them separately.
</td></tr>

</div>

<h2 class=mtn>Targeting Including TARI</h2>

<p>Targeting is where Past Information - if available - is entered, and the actual targeting that sets the goals for the business is performed.</p>

<p>The outcome will provide the TARI, or Target Average Rate Index, for the business or a department of the business.</p>

<p>In the case of a retail/wholesale business, where number of sales is the key driving activity, TARI will refer to the Target Average Gross Per Sale (as measured by a cash ring-up or an invoice).</p>

<p>In the case of a manufacturing or service business, where hours billed is the measure of the key driving activity, TARI will refer to the Target Average Gross Profit Per Hour (where gross profit equals sales cost of goods or materials used).</p>

<p>Other targets such as for Gross Profit and Net Profit are also set here.</p>

<table class=mb11>
<tr><td><h4>Feature</h4>
</td><td><h4>Benefit</h4>
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Past Information</b>
</td><td>TARI for Business allows easy entry of past Financial Data where available, ranging from one year to five or more to reveal trends.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>What If</b>
</td><td>The "What If" part of Targeting provides three scenarios for developing TARI and other targets. Select a base data source (past period or a previous target) for your "what if" and then set up 3 possible outcomes based on the most likely, pessimistic, or optimistic views of the period ahead. The results become a set of targets against which progress is measured.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Dynamic Targeting</b>
</td><td>Targeting is dynamic and not confined to a financial period. This allows new targets to be set at any time to reflect changes in the business due to a changed economic environment, or new competitive threats.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>No Fixed Period</b>
</td><td>TARI for Business can be set up at any time and the dates specifying when a period starts and ends (up to a year in a period) changed as needed. When dates are changed, any data entered remains attached to its date and is available when next that date is included in the current period.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Flexible, Simple Chart of Accounts</b>
</td><td>TARI for Business needs few accounts as it deals with generating income rather than tracking every expense transaction. That's for your transaction accounting software. TARI for Business focuses on generating profit and controlling productivity.<br><br>
For the few accounts which are needed, a standard chart of accounts is used which you can add to, or modify to match the accounts used by your existing accounting software.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>No account numbers to enter</b>
</td><td>Entering information other than invoice data is achieved simply by putting an amount in a field, or using the mouse to drag a value up or down.

  <p class='b c'>Tracking Invoice Grouping<br>(Sales)</p>
</div>

<h2 class=mtn>Tracking</h2>

<p>Tracking is where  business activity as it happens is tracked to compare progress with target. For TARI to work its wonders, sales data should be entered frequently, preferably daily, but not less than weekly. Monthly is OK for expense data.</p>

<table class=mb11>
<tr><td><h4>Feature</h4>
</td><td><h4>Benefit</h4>
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Fast Tracking Results</b>
</td><td>Only 3 figures are required each day or week to drive a very powerful Key Indicator Report.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>No&nbsp;Fixed&nbsp;Period</b>
</td><td>As with Targeting, Tracking does not involve fixed time periods. Dates can be specified to suit when when a period starts and ends (up to a year in a period). When dates are changed, any data entered remains attached to its date and is available when next that date is included in the current period.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Improve Billing of Hours</b>
</td><td>For any business selling labor hours, tracking spells out actual versus targeted productivity, and so prompts for meeting the targeted daily or weekly performance goals, either by improving the level of activity or the contribution per unit of activity.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Improve Goods Sales</b>
</td><td>For any business selling goods, off or on the web, tracking spells out actual versus targeted daily and/or weekly sales volume and prompts for action to meet or surpass the weekly profit target either by improving the number of sales, or the contribution per sale.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Invoice Grouping by Quote, Personnel or Product</b>
</td><td>Tracking  performance of a job against a quote or products against a monthly sales target, provides a definitive advantage because unlike many sales budgets, it's based on a desired profit contribution not merely sales volume.
</td></tr>

<table class=mb11>
<tr><td><h4>Feature</h4>
</td><td><h4>Benefit</h4>
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Pulse at a Glance</b>
</td><td>Most TARI for Business reports are one page enabling the "important" to stand out and not be lost in the details.<br><br>
This means that the Pulse of the business can be seen at a glance without trawling through printouts and mind numbing out of date figures.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Optional Consolidation</b>
</td><td>When a business has more than one key activity (Department/Revenue Group), reports can be generated by department, or consolidated for the whole business.<br><br>
This provides you with the big picture as well as the detail of each section of the business.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>PDF Output</b>
</td><td>All reports can be produced as a PDF file, which can be emailed for viewing by anyone. This facilitates internal use of the TARI results, as well as interaction with external people such as bankers and advisors. No additional software is required for this facility.
