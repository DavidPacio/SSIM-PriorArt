<h1 class=c>Braiins Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h1>
<table class='itran mc' style=width:700px>
<tr>
<td><h3>Q.</h3></td><td><h3>I have entered my invoices in the Business Simulator, set up a TARI<span class=s>&reg;</span> and targeted for the year ahead. What more do I need to do?</h3></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='c b'>A.</td>
<td>You have done well!  However, setting up TARI<span class=s>&reg;</span> and targeting ahead is only the first step on the road to boosting the bottom line. You need to track your invoices and compare them with TARI<span class=s>&reg;</span> day-by-day as well as track and compare the total weekly and accumulatively.<br><br>Subscribing for TARI enables you to do that.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><h3>Q.</h3></td><td><h3>Can't I do that on a spreadsheet without having to subscribe?</h3></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='c b'>A.</td>
<td>Spreadsheets are fine for a limited number of invoices, however they lack the flexibility required when it comes to accumulating, extracting, grouping and comparing by product, customer or personnel with TARI<span class=s>&reg;</span> provided by the software.</td>
</tr>

<tr><td><h3>Q.</h3></td><td><h3>How much does TARI Cost?</h3></td></tr>
<tr>
<td class='c b'>A.</td>
<td>US$27.75 per month for the TARI for Business software supplied via the <a href='https://www.tarionline.com/pub/Jade.htm' title='TARI Jade Subscription'>Jade Subscription</a> service. There is no contract or lock-in. You can cancel at any time. Though once you start seeing how much TARI can do for your business, we don't think you will ever want to be without it.<br>
<br>
If you would like direct personal contact for advisory input and back-up from the TARI team, a limited number of Platinum Subscriptions are available. For these, the price depends on individual business needs, and is agreed with you by phone and/or email once you have completed the <a href='https://www.tarionline.com/pub/Platinum.htm' title='Platinum Subscription - Expression of Interest'>Platinum Subscription - Expression of Interest form</a> to start the process.<br>
<br>
Consulting advice is also available from independent TARI Experts, Accountants or Management Consultants, located via <a href='http://www.tarinetwork.com/' title='TARI Network for TARI Contacts'>TARI Network</a>. In this case, fees would be negotiated directly between the consultant/advisor and you.</td>
</tr>

<tr><td><h3>Q.</h3></td><td><h3>Is the software for sale?</h3></td></tr>
<tr><td class='c b'>A.</td><td>No, subscription only, as above.</td></tr>

<tr><td><h3>Q.</h3></td><td><h3>What benefits will TARI<span class=s>&reg;</span> give me?</h3></td></tr>
<tr><td class='c b'>A.</td><td>TARI will:<ul>
  <li>Increase productivity, output and hence profitability</li>
  <li>Focus pricing and planning decisions only on those activities which give your business a competitive edge</li>
  <li>Save you money and time as you know which transactions are unprofitable</li>
  <li>Quickly provide clear, relevant, usable information: feedback of results compared with target, and a woods-eye view of overall performance at all times</li>
  <li>Unite and inspire management and staff to continually improve business performance by understanding how their unique contribution impacts the business</li>
</ul>

<tr><td><h3>Q.</h3></td>
<td><h3>What help do you provide with getting us going with the Jade level subscription?</h3></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='c b'>A.</td>
<td>TARI for Business comes with an already set-up business that you can "play with" to become familiar with the software before setting up your own business.<br>
<br>
As well, the software includes extensive integrated help available at every step.<br>
<br>
Then training videos are available online. There are currently 8 of these, two public:<ul>

<tr>
<td><h3>Q.</h3></td>
<td><h3>You say the Jade level subscription is supported with integrated help, email support, and online with traning videos, FAQs, newsletters, blogs etc. What if we come across a bug in the software?</h3></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='c b'>A.</td>
<td>If any bugs are found they will be corrected post-haste.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><h3>Q.</h3></td>
<td><h3>As a Jade member, what if we need non-software advice about our business. Can we contact you?</h3></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='c b'>A.</td>
<td>The low monthly subscription cost of a Jade membership, intended to make TARI accessible to almost any business in the world, does not permit individual consulting to be provided.<br>
<br>However, as indicated in "How much does TARI cost?" above, both software and non-software consulting advice is available to Platinum level members via at an agreed (higher) monthly subscription rate set according to the business and its needs.<br>
<br>
Further, consulting advice is available from independent TARI Experts, Accountants or Management Consultants, located via <a href='http://www.tarinetwork.com/' title='TARI Network for TARI Contacts'>TARI Network</a>.</td>
