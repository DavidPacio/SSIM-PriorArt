  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>Headings are single lines of text of up to 100 characters in length used by Braiins when generating accounts. This window allows you to change the Braiins master headings to suit your preferred wording. Any edits you make will be reflected in all generated sets of accounts which use that heading.</p>
  <p>The 'Ref' has no special accounting or iXBRL tag meaning. It is just a way to refer to a particular heading.</p>
  <h4>Editing Headings</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Click on one of your headings to edit it. When you leave the field using the keyboard or by clicking somewhere else the changed value is saved. If you edit a heading to nothing it reverts to the Braiins Master value.</li>
  <li>Click the Ref Column heading to sort in the other direction.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
