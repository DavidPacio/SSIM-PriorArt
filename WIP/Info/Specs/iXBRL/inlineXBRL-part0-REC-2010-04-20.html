         <h1>1 Introduction</h1>
         <p> 

Inline XBRL was created to avoid the need to create visual renderings of XBRL
instance documents.
 
      </p> 
         <p> 

Conventional XML data documents (like XBRL instance documents) maintain a
separation of data and rendering instructions.  The data is kept in the XML
data document, and the rendering instructions are kept in a stylesheet or
separate application.  Where the structure of the data is known in advance,
this is efficient and simple.  XBRL, however, is based on taxonomies and not
schemas: the precise data content of a document is often not known in advance.
This makes it difficult to devise satisfactory rendering instructions.

      </p> 
         <p> 

Inline XBRL is a mechanism for allowing the author of the XBRL instance
document to specify the visual rendering of the data.  It does this by
providing a method for incorporating XBRL instance data and metadata into an
HTML or XHTML document.  The <a href="#IXBRL-PART1">[Inline XBRL Specification]</a> defines how this data
and metadata can then be used to construct an XBRL instance document.

      </p> 
      </div>
      <div class="div1"><a name="d1e77" id="d1e77"></a>
         <h1>2 Structure</h1>
         <div class="div2"><a name="d1e82" id="d1e82"></a>
            <h2>2.1 The Inline XBRL Document</h2>
            <p>

The Inline XBRL Document is typically a single XHTML document which, when
displayed in a browser, provides a full visual rendering of given XBRL data.
An Inline XBRL processor (a "Processor"), given that Inline XBRL Document, will
generate an XBRL instance document.

        </p>
            <p>

In the Inline XBRL Document, data values are nested within Inline XBRL Elements
which are themselves nested within HTML or XHTML elements ("Markup Elements").
This technique relies upon the ability of browsers to ignore XML elements that
it does not recognise.  The browser, in effect, ignores the Inline XBRL
Elements and displays the data values as though they were textual content of
the Markup Elements.  A Processor will ignore the Markup Elements and combine
the Inline XBRL Elements and the data values to generate an XBRL instance
document (the "Target Document").
  
        </p>
         </div>
         <div class="div2"><a name="d1e94" id="d1e94"></a>
            <h2>2.2 Multiple documents</h2>
            <p>

Current browsers impose an effective maximum size limit on the files that
they can handle.  The financial statements for a large company, which might be
in the order of five megabytes in size, are too large for most browsers to
handle today.

        </p> 
            <p> 

To get round this limitation, a complete set of Inline XBRL information can be
split across multiple documents.  The <a href="#IXBRL-PART1">[Inline XBRL Specification]</a> allows
a set of documents, which together may form part of a web-site, to be
treated as a single Inline XBRL Document Set ("IXDS").  There are few
restrictions relating to the division of metadata between the different
documents in the document set, so it is open to the author to repeat metadata
across documents or to abstract common metadata (such as context information)
into a header document.

        </p> 
            <div class="nonNormativeExample">

When constructing multiple documents, be careful to use relative URLs in
hyperlinks between the documents, so that they don't break when moved to other
environments.

        </div> 
            <p> 

The <a href="#IXBRL-PART1">[Inline XBRL Specification]</a> allows (although it does NOT recommend) the
IXDS to consist of both HTML and XHTML documents.  The <a href="#IXBRL-PART1">[Inline XBRL Specification]</a> requires that a Validating Conformant Processor validate
any XHTML documents against the Schema, but it will not validate or process a
mixed-type IXDS.

        </p>
         </div>
         <div class="div2"><a name="d1e118" id="d1e118"></a>
            <h2>2.3 Target documents</h2>
            <p>

Inline XBRL allows more than one Target Document to be created from the Inline
XBRL Document, so as to make it possible to take two (or more) separate XBRL
reports and display the data in a single web page.  This allows the author to
build an HTML page which combines comparative data from different companies
which, when processed, would become a set of financial reports, one for each
company.

        </p> 
            <p> 

But it is important not to confuse the mechanism for multiple input documents
(i.e., the IXDS) with that for multiple output documents (i.e. Target
Documents).  It was never the intention that the multiple documents in the IXDS
would map into multiple Target Documents, although it is possible to construct
an IXDS in this way.  Any two random Inline XBRL Documents - which, when
processed would create individual Target Documents - will often not be suitable
to be treated as constituent parts of the same IXDS, because of the need to
ensure that IDs and references are unique across the IXDS, and that the target
attributes are set appropriately.

        </p> 
            <p> 

Each Inline XBRL Element is mapped to a given Target Document.  The Target
Document is identified logically (but not physically) by means of the "target"
attribute (if any) on that Inline XBRL Element.  If there is no target
attribute then the Inline XBRL Element will map to the "default" Target
Document.

        </p> 
            <p> 

There is no distinction, other than the convenience of the specification,
between specified Target Documents and the default Target Document.  It follows
that, if there are no target attributes, there will be only one Target Document
and that will be the default Target Document.  On the other hand, if target
attributes are set on all the appropriate Inline XBRL Elements, there will be
no default Target Document, and if the value of all those target attributes is
the same then there will be only one Target Document.

        </p> 
            <p> 

It follows that, if the target attribute is never specified in the IXDS, all
output will be mapped to the same, single, Target Document.  If target
attributes are provided in some cases but not in others there will always be at
least two Target Documents produced.  Note that it is never possible to map
the same element to more than one Target Document (although it may be possible
to map the same data to more than one Target Document by the use of XML
nesting).

        </p> 
         </div>
         <div class="div2"><a name="d1e140" id="d1e140"></a>
            <h2>2.4 Use of ID types</h2>
            <p>

Because Inline XBRL can use multiple documents, use of IDs and IDREFs is scoped
across the IXDS rather than the individual Inline XBRL Document.  Thus, an item
of type IDREF must have a matching ID somewhere within the IXDS, not
necessarily within the same Inline XBRL Document.  However, the conventional
method of IDREF typing (as defined in <a href="#XMLSCHEMA-DATATYPES">[XML Schema Datatypes]</a>) can
only be applied, for validation purposes, to a single document.

        </p>
            <p>

We considered requiring that schema validation be applied to an IXDS that had
been merged to create a single document.  However, while the Inline XBRL Elements in
the IXDS can be merged without danger to the semantics, the Markup Elements
cannot.  There are issues relating to merging common elements - like
<code>HTML</code>, <code>HEAD</code> and <code>BODY</code> - which would make
it difficult to validate the document with confidence after the merge.

        </p>
            <p>

The problem is that schema validation using the XHTML Modular Schema covers
both the Inline XBRL elements and the Markup Elements.  Given that the merge
can have unpredictable results on the validity of the XHTML, it is sensible to
restrict schema-level validation to each individual Inline XBRL Document rather
than the IXDS.

        </p>
            <p>

We have accordingly avoided IDREF and IDREFS types in the <a href="#IXBRL-PART2">[Inline XBRL Schema]</a>, making use of <code>xs:NCName</code> types instead,
replacing the implicit schema constraints with appropriate
<strong>MUST</strong>s within the <a href="#IXBRL-PART1">[Inline XBRL Specification]</a>.  These
<strong>MUST</strong>s are then tested by proprietary code within the
Validating Conformant Processor, which can do so without concern about the
impact of merging on XHTML validation.

        </p>
            <p>

We have taken the same approach with the optional <code>id</code> attribute,
which uses the <code>xs:NCName</code> type, and is required by the <a href="#IXBRL-PART1">[Inline XBRL Specification]</a> to be unique across the IXDS.   By requiring id attributes
to be unique across the IXDS it becomes simpler for the Processor to identify
elements, should that be necessary.

        </p>
            <div class="nonNormativeExample">

Authors should therefore be aware that <code>contextRef</code>,
<code>footnoteID</code>, <code>footnoteRefs</code>, <code>id</code>,
<code>tupleID</code>, <code>tupleRef</code> and <code>unitRef</code>
               <span class="term">attributes</span> are validated with reference to the IXDS and not the
individual Inline XBRL Document.

            <h2>3.1 Inline XBRL documents</h2>
            <p>

The <a href="#IXBRL-PART1">[Inline XBRL Specification]</a> provides for different levels of conforming
Inline XBRL documents.  Inline XBRL documents will generally be HTML or XHTML.
They can also, in theory, be any other well-formed XML dialect.  All must, of
course, be compliant with the specification but only XHTML documents can be
validated using the normative <a href="#IXBRL-PART2">[Inline XBRL Schema]</a>.

        </p>
            <p>

The following table summarises the validation framework for Inline XBRL
documents.  It is described in fuller detail in the following paragraphs.

It is worth noting that HTML documents are not often well-formed, and that most
authoring tools may have more success creating XHTML than well-formed HTML.  We
would strongly recommend the use of XHTML rather than HTML.  We expect that
most Inline XBRL applications will in fact require XHTML.

        </div>
            <p>

The specification, however, does not outlaw non-XHTML dialects because we
wanted to encourage as-yet unforeseen uses of Inline XBRL to develop in the future
with the full benefit of the specification.  There is, in fact, no technical
reason short of validation why non-XHTML dialects should not be as acceptable a
host for Inline XBRL as XHTML.

            <h2>3.2 Processors</h2>
            <p>
           
The purpose of the Processor is to generate XBRL from an IXDS without reference
to any taxonomy.  Even so, there are different types of Processors:
 
        </p>
            <div class="div3"><a name="d1e348" id="d1e348"></a>
               <h3>3.2.1 The Conformant Processor</h3>
               <p>

The Conformant Processor must be able to handle multiple input documents (which
together comprise the IXDS) and be able to generate multiple Target Documents. 

          </p>
            </div>
            <div class="div3"><a name="d1e357" id="d1e357"></a>
               <h3>3.2.2 The Validating Conformant Processor</h3>
               <p>

The Validating Conformant Processor is required to validate the IXDS and may
only validate an IXDS which consists solely of XHTML documents.  If (and only
if) the IXDS is valid, it will then generate the Target Document(s).

          </p>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div class="div2"><a name="d1e367" id="d1e367"></a>
            <h2>3.3 Validation</h2>
            <p>

Validation is the process which must be carried out in full by a Validating
Conformant Processor on any XHTML document.  Validation involves:

        </p>
            <ol>
               <li>

testing that the IXDS meets the rules set out in the
<a href="#IXBRL-PART1">[Inline XBRL Specification]</a>; and

          </li>
               <li>

validating each of the Inline XBRL Documents against the <a href="#IXBRL-PART2">[Inline XBRL Schema]</a>.

          </li>
            </ol>
            <p>

For the purposes of the conformance suite, a set of Schematron rules have been
created, which test many of the rules set out in the <a href="#IXBRL-PART1">[Inline XBRL Specification]</a>.
Together, the Schematron rules and the Schema provide nearly-complete coverage
of all the requirements of the <a href="#IXBRL-PART1">[Inline XBRL Specification]</a>. 

        </p>
            <p>

Note that while the rules in the <a href="#IXBRL-PART1">[Inline XBRL Specification]</a> and the <a href="#IXBRL-PART2">[Inline XBRL Schema]</a> are both normative (the latter only for XHTML-based
documents), the Schematron rules are non-normative.  This is because the
Schematron rules are encapsulations of the (normative) <strong>MUST</strong>s
in the <a href="#IXBRL-PART1">[Inline XBRL Specification]</a>, while the <a href="#IXBRL-PART2">[Inline XBRL Schema]</a>
covers concepts which are not in all cases made explicit in the <a href="#IXBRL-PART1">[Inline XBRL Specification]</a>.

        </p>
            <p>

The implication of this is that application of the Schematron rules will NOT
necessarily meet the requirement for a Validating Conformant Processor to test
that the IXDS meets the rules set out in the <a href="#IXBRL-PART1">[Inline XBRL Specification]</a>.

        </p>
         </div>
         <p>

The <a href="#IXBRL-PART2">[Inline XBRL Schema]</a> uses a modular technique which involves
extending the XHTML Schema to accept Inline XBRL Elements within the XHTML
document.  The Schema also makes use of parts of the schemas for XBRL, but to
accomplish this some changes have had to be made to the structure of the XBRL
Schemas that are referenced by the modular <a href="#IXBRL-PART1">[Inline XBRL Specification]</a>.  The
re-structured schemas logically define identical instance document content
models as the normative XBRL Schemas.

               <p>

The conformance suite consists largely of pairs of IXDSs and Target Documents.
Each pair is illustrative of a conforming transformation.  Both a Conformant
Processor and a Validating Conformant Processor will, when processing a given
IXDS, generate the associated Target Documents; if it does not, it will not be
deemed conformant.

The conformance suite also includes IXDSs that are not valid, which are
used only to test Validating Conformant Processors.  A Validating Conformant
Processor will, when processing an invalid IXDS, generate a failure message.

               <h3>3.5.1 Doctype</h3>
               <p> 

Setting a <code>DOCTYPE</code> in the Inline XBRL Document will, in many
processing situations, trigger an attempt to validate against a DTD.  We did
not plan for the use of DTDs in Inline XBRL because of lack of support for
<span class="term">namespaces</span> in DTDs.  There is therefore no normative DTD for Inline XBRL.

          </p> 
               <div class="nonNormativeExample">

We strongly advise against setting a <code>DOCTYPE</code> in Inline XBRL
Documents, because it is liable to lead to a validation failure.

               <h3>3.5.2 Version</h3>
               <p> 

The <code>version</code>&nbsp;<span class="term">attribute</span> can, optionally, be used
to identify a document as Inline XBRL.  If used, the value
<strong>MUST</strong> be the Formal Public Identifier defined in <a href="#IXBRL-PART2">[Inline XBRL Schema]</a> (currently "-//XBRL International//DTD XHTML Inline XBRL
1.0//EN").

          </p> 
               <p> 

It is worth noting that the Public Text Class "DTD", when used as part of the
Formal Public Identifier, means "document type declaration subset" and not
"Document Type Definition"; so the use of the Formal Public Identifier should
not be taken to imply the existence of a Document Type Definition.

               <h3>3.5.3 Namespace</h3>
               <p> 

The Inline XBRL <span class="term">namespace name</span>,
<code>http://www.xbrl.org/2008/inlineXBRL</code>, identifies Inline XBRL
elements with the 1.0 version of this standard (and all its errata corrections,
if any).  Any subsequent versions of this standard (i.e., non-errata correction
changes which have an impact on validity) will have a new <span class="term">namespace
name</span>, such as (for instance)
<code>http://www.xbrl.org/2015/inlineXBRL</code>.

          </p> 
            </div>

               <h3>3.5.4 Processing Inline XBRL</h3>
               <p> 

Because the version attribute is optional, it cannot be relied upon by
Processors seeking to identify a document as Inline XBRL.  Instead, a Processor
will look for (a) the <span class="term">namespace</span> of the root <code>HTML</code>
element, which should have the <span class="term">namespace name</span><code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code>; and (b) the existence of one or more
elements which have the
<code>http://www.xbrl.org/2008/inlineXBRL</code>&nbsp;<span class="term">namespace
name</span>.

          </p> 
               <p>

It will often be the case that the <span class="term">namespace name</span> of the root
element will have a schema location hint leading the Processor to
<code>http://www.xbrl.org/2008/inlineXBRL/xhtml-inlinexbrl-1_0.xsd</code>: but
this location is not mandatory (and so cannot be relied upon) and will in any
case (for security or performance considerations) often be ignored by the
Processor.
  
          </p> 
               <p>

The implication of using the Inline XBRL <span class="term">namespace name</span> as a key
identifier is that a Processor is not allowed to distinguish between the REC
version of the specification and subsequent errata, if any.  The Processor must
support both REC and all the errata.

          </p> 
            </div>

               <h3>3.5.5 Non-XHTML</h3>
               <p> 

A document which does not have a root <code>HTML</code> element (or which has a
root <code>HTML</code> element which does not have the <span class="term">namespace
name</span> "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml") but which does include one or more
elements which have the "http://www.xbrl.org/2008/inlineXBRL" <span class="term">namespace
name</span> can still be in full compliance with the Inline XBRL specification
and therefore can be considered prima facie an Inline XBRL Document.  A
Conformant Processor is expected to process such a document successfully, if it
is in compliance with the specification.  However, a Validating Conformant
Processor will not successfully validate such a document and is not allowed to
process it further.

          </p> 
               <p> 

If the document complies with the specification the Processor will be able to
generate the Target Document successfully.  However, in the absence of
validation there is no obvious way of determining compliance and the behaviour
of the Processor in the presence of a non-compliant document is not defined by
the specification.  The purpose of this treatment is to allow well-formed XML
(other than XHTML) to host Inline XBRL Elements.  As mentioned above, had we
forbidden any host markup other than XHTML it would have outlawed potential
future uses of the Specification.

         <div class="div2"><a name="d1e597" id="d1e597"></a>
            <h2>4.1 Transformation Rules</h2>
            <p>

The <a href="#IXBRL-PART1">[Inline XBRL Specification]</a> provides examples of Transformation Rules, but
the normative list will be maintained separately.  The transformations will
require different implementations for different execution environments.

        </p>
            <p>

Transformation Rules may be thought of as parsing rules; they convert textual
displays into XML Schema data types having canonical lexical representations
along with XBRL specific attributes. Transformation Rules producing types
derived from <code>xs:decimal</code>, in particular, must interpret the
<code>decimals</code> and <code>precision</code>&nbsp;<span class="term">attributes</span>
and produce not only a canonical lexical representation but also corresponding
<code>decimals</code> and <code>precision</code>&nbsp;<span class="term">attributes</span>.  

        </p>
            <p>

There is a long tail of potentially useful transformations to parse currency
symbols, dates (in a variety of formats), Boolean values, texts written
right-to-left, Chinese, and other display formats. The registry is a practical
means for covering a large set of critical numeric and date types for browser
execution, XSL and other key environments, while allowing for growth in the set
of transformations and implementations.           

        </p>

         <div class="div2"><a name="d1e636" id="d1e636"></a>
            <h2>4.2 Transformation Rules Registries</h2>
            <p>

Transformation Rules are stored in a Transformation Rules Registry which may
consist of multiple versions, over time.  Within a registry a function is
identified by its <span class="term">local name</span>, with the presumption that the
function assigned to that <span class="term">local name</span> will never change.  Functions
will persist from one version of the registry to the next, and only be dropped
from subsequent versions in the case of deprecation.  This allows the creation
of a set of Transformation Rules and their amendment over time while
maintaining clarity as to content and purpose.

        </p>
            <p>

A given registry is identified by its <span class="term">namespace</span>, which will
incorporate the date that that version of the registry was accorded REC status.
This neatly resolves the issue of <span class="term">errata corrections</span> - because
errata don't have a REC date they can't have a separate <span class="term">namespace</span>
and so must be identified with any reference to the underlying registry
version.

        </p>
            <p>

For developers, the <span class="term">namespace</span> mechanism provides both clarity as
to the identification of the set of functions being supported, and a simple way
to upgrade provision from one version of a registry to another.

            <h2>4.3 The Specified Registry</h2>
            <p>

The Specified Registry is the initial version of the registry defined by XBRL
International and which is required to be supported by any processor which
supports Inline XBRL.  It should be noted that subsequent versions of that
registry are not required to be supported, although we would expect that
implementations of Inline XBRL will probably seek to do so.

        </p>
            <p>

It was intended by the authors of the specification that the Specified Registry
would meet the needs of regulators and other users of Inline XBRL.  The
registry framework, as described above, nevertheless provides a clean mechanism
for the creation and maintenance of other registries by third parties.

        </p>
            <p>

It should be noted that the <span class="term">namespace name</span> given to the Specified
Registry was changed when the specification was accorded REC status (so as to
incorporate the REC date) and is therefore not the same <span class="term">namespace
name</span> as was published in the Proposed REC and previous versions of the
specification.

         <h1>5 Mapping values to the Target Document</h1>
         <p>

Every XBRL fact and xlink relationship in the Target Document must be justified
by reference to an appropriate Inline XBRL Element in the input data.  This
means that the Target Document is not allowed to contain other facts or
relationships.  (It does not, incidentally, prohibit duplication, if duplicates
are present in the input data.)  Nor does it restrict contexts and units, which
may be included in the Target Document whether or not they appeared in the
input document.

      </p>
         <div class="div2"><a name="d1e699" id="d1e699"></a>
            <h2>5.1 Contexts</h2>
            <p>

Inline XBRL does not specify any way for the text content of Markup Elements
displayed in a browser to be transformed into the content of contexts in the
target documents. Dates appearing in column headings, for example, normally
appear in the IXDS as Markup Elements without any Inline XBRL Element
ancestors.  Management of the contexts referenced by
<code>xbrli:contextRef</code>&nbsp;<span class="term">attributes</span> in the IXDS is done
as in any other XBRL creation process.

        </p>
         </div>
         <div class="div2"><a name="d1e714" id="d1e714"></a>
            <h2>5.2 Duplicates</h2>
            <p>

Financial statements normally have at least a handful of facts that appear in
more than one location in an IXDS.  Net Income, for example, may appear both
on an Income Statement and a Statement of Cash Flows. If both occurrences in
the IXDS are tagged with the same element and context, and have the same actual
or default {target} property, the output may contain both occurrences.

        </p>
            <p>

In some cases it will be desired that such occurrences ("duplicates") are
removed from the output.  However, the rules for de-duplication will vary from
occasion to occasion.  Duplicates as defined by the XBRL v2.1 Specification can
only be determined by reference to the DTS.  Because Processors are not
required to access the DTS, it cannot be assumed that a Processor will be able
to carry out XBRL-level de-duplication.  In addition, because it is possible to
add user-defined (non-Inline XBRL) attributes to Inline XBRL Elements, output
elements which are XBRL-s-equal may actually contain different attribute-level
information.

        </p>
            <p>

The <a href="#IXBRL-PART1">[Inline XBRL Specification]</a> therefore allows de-duplication to be carried
out at the discretion of the Processor.

        </p>
            <p>

In some cases, either because of different rounding conventions or by mistake,
a pair of facts may match as to element name, context and {target} property,
but may have different values.  The <a href="#IXBRL-PART1">[Inline XBRL Specification]</a>requires that
both facts appear in the Target Document.  This is not illegal XBRL but it is
very much to be deplored.  

        </p>
            <div class="nonNormativeExample">

Avoid including matching facts with different values in the IXDS.

        </div>
            <p>

In the case of tuple children, however, the creation of duplicates in the
target document will often be schema-invalid.  For this reason, duplicate tuple
children are removed prior to mapping.  To keep the Processor as light-weight
as possible, duplicates for these purposes are defined as those with the same
tuple order value.  To validate that these two elements do indeed have the same
value, a string-comparison mechanism is used.   This is more restrictive than
the XBRL v2.1 Specification, which allows (say) for two elements with the same
value to use different schemaRef attributes.  Such elements would fail Inline XBRL
validation.  We consider that the benefits of this restriction, by making it
easier to process Inline XBRL, outweigh any drawbacks.

            <h2>5.3 Equal values</h2>
            <p>

An author might wish for a fragment of text in an IXDS to correspond to more
than one fact in a Target Document. For example, a formatted date such as "25
June 2008" may need to appear in the target document both as a tuple with day,
month and year, and separately as an item of type dateTime. Inline XBRL does not
support a one-to-many mapping of source text to facts.

        </p>
            <div class="nonNormativeExample">
        
The correct way to handle "one to many" mappings is to tag the text with one of
the mappings, and place the other output tag inside an
<code>ix:hidden</code>&nbsp;<span class="term">element</span>.

         </div>
         <div class="div2"><a name="d1e762" id="d1e762"></a>
            <h2>5.4 Totalling</h2>
            <p>

A special case of "Equal values" would be a numeric value displayed in the
Inline XBRL Document that is meant to map to more than one output fact, the sum
of which is the displayed total. (Note that in some regulatory environments,
this would clearly not be acceptable.) The displayed figure would have no
Inline XBRL tags at all; the output facts would simply appear as Inline XBRL
Elements inside the <code>ix:hidden</code>&nbsp;<span class="term">element</span>.

        </p>
         </div>
         <div class="div2"><a name="d1e777" id="d1e777"></a>
            <h2>5.5 Nested tags</h2>
            <p>

There is, however, a special case where "dual tagging" of a single piece of
displayed text is permissible.  Individual pieces of data which fall within an
<code>ix:nonNumeric</code> tag may also themselves be tagged.  So a textual
note can be tagged as <code>ix:nonNumeric</code> and parts of the text (say, a
fraction) can also be tagged (in this case, as <code>ix:fraction</code>).  That
fraction will appear twice in the target document, once as part of the textual
note and once as a numeric <span class="term">fact</span>.

        </p>
            <p>

A single date within <code>ix:nonNumeric</code> tags could, for instance, be
nested inside a further set of <code>ix:nonNumeric</code> tags.  The date would
appear twice in the target document, once for each <code>ix:nonNumeric</code>
element.  If the date was in the form, say, "July 14, 1789" then both
<code>ix:nonNumeric</code> elements would include the attribute
<code>format="ixt:datelongus"</code>, and both dates in the Target Document
would appear in the canonical form "1789-07-14".

        </p>
            <p>

By using the <code>ix:exclude</code> element it is possible to remove part of
the content of the <code>ix:nonNumeric</code> element from the output in the
Target Document.  But any <code>ix:</code> tags which are nested within that
<code>ix:exclude</code> element will continue to be processed in their own
right (although no longer as part of the host <code>ix:nonNumeric</code>
element).

            <h2>5.6 Nested tuples</h2>
            <p>

Tuples can be nested, either physically or by reference (the latter by using
<code>tupleRef</code> and <code>tupleID</code>).  There is no limit to the
recursion, except that it is not permitted for tuple content to include, in its
own tuple content, the parent tuple.

            <h2>5.7 Signs</h2>
            <p>
  
Inline XBRL requires that numerics (<code>ix:denominator</code>,
<code>ix:numerator</code> and <code>ix:nonFraction</code>) must use the
<code>sign</code>&nbsp;<span class="term">attribute</span> to indicate negative values.  Any
negative indicator (dash, brackets, or colour-coding) must be positioned in the
Inline XBRL Document outside the relevant Inline XBRL Element.  The content of
the relevant Inline XBRL Element will therefore always be a non-negative
number, unless the format attribute is present and a transformation is thus
indicated.

        </p>
            <p>

Data values which are to be transformed must either represent non-numerics
(e.g. dates) or they must also represent (allowing for commas and other
formatting) non-negative numerics.  No transformation may be used to change the
sign of the content.  This enforces the general requirement that all numeric
values in Inline XBRL are always positive, and values which are required to be
negative in the Target Document may only be represented by use of the <code>sign</code>
attribute.

         <div class="div2"><a name="d1e879" id="d1e879"></a>
            <h2>5.8 Other attributes</h2>
            <p><a href="#XBRL">[XBRL 2.1]</a> allows the addition of <span class="term">attributes</span>, other
than those defined in the <a href="#IXBRL-PART1">[Inline XBRL Specification]</a>, to an XBRL instance
document.  For instance, it may be desired to give
<code>xml:id</code>&nbsp;<span class="term">attributes</span> to <span class="term">elements</span> in
the XBRL instance document.  Inline XBRL allows the matching addition of "other
attributes", in a number of places, to provide for this.


        </p>
            <p>

Note that for some <span class="term">elements</span> (<code>ix:footnote</code>,
<code>ix:denominator</code> and <code>ix:numerator</code>) the definition of
"other attributes" is explicitly more permissive than is the
<span class="term">attribute</span> model for that <span class="term">element</span>.  This is because
definitions which explicitly matched the <span class="term">attribute</span> model would
not, in fact, encompass <span class="term">attributes</span> such as those with the
<code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance</code>&nbsp;<span class="term">namespace
name</span> which are not referenced in the schema but which are legal in both
Inline XBRL and XBRL v2.1.  In the case of <code>ix:denominator</code> and
<code>ix:numerator</code>, <span class="term">attributes</span> with the
<code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance</code>&nbsp;<span class="term">namespace
name</span> are actually the only legal members of "other attributes".

            <h2>6.1 Markup elements in text data</h2>
            <p>

The Inline XBRL equivalents to XBRL text-based facts are
<code>ix:footnote</code> and <code>ix:nonNumeric</code>.  There are some
important differences in the treatment of the content of these
<span class="term">elements</span>.  Neither has any restriction on <span class="term">element</span>
content; in practice this means the content may be <code>ix: elements</code> or
Markup Elements.  Both can therefore accommodate the nesting of
<code>ix:</code>&nbsp;<span class="term">elements</span> and both use the
<code>ix:exclude</code> element to remove content from the mapped data.

        </p>
            <p>

However, they are very different in their treatment of Markup Elements.  In
Inline XBRL, most Markup Elements are discarded upon processing, but this is
not the case for <code>ix:footnote</code> and <code>ix:nonNumeric</code>.  The
<code>ix:footnote</code>&nbsp;<span class="term">element</span> includes full Markup
Elements in its mappable value, in conformance with the content model for
<code>link:footnote</code> in <a href="#XBRL">[XBRL 2.1]</a>.  However, <a href="#XBRL">[XBRL 2.1]</a> does not allow Markup Elements in non-numeric facts.  Inline XBRL
provides that Markup Elements are only mapped to the Target Document if the
<code>escape</code>&nbsp;<span class="term">attribute</span> has been set to true, in which
case the Markup Elements are XML-escaped in the Target Document.  If the
<code>escape</code>&nbsp;<span class="term">attribute</span> is false, the HTML or XHTML
tags are discarded prior to mapping.

            <h2>6.2 XML-escaping</h2>
            <p>


XML-escaped Markup Elements, where they are found in non-numeric XBRL facts, is
used most commonly in US SEC reporting, to provide some local formatting for
large blocks of text.

        </p>
            <p>

XML-escaping may be achieved by escaping individual characters or by enclosing
the text in a CDATA block.  It is up to the Processor to determine whether to
use CDATA blocks or character escaping, because both options are treated as
equivalent in <a href="#XML">[XML]</a>.

        </p>
            <p>

The full definition of XML-escaping can be found in <a href="#XML">[XML]</a>.  In
Inline XBRL, XML-escaping applies both to Markup Elements and Markup Elements
that have already been escaped in the original <code>ix:nonNumeric</code>
element.  In the latter case, the mapped output will be "double-escaped".
Note, however, that the XML specification forbids the nesting of CDATA blocks.

        </p>
            <p>

By way of example, the XML  &lt;b&gt; Hello World &lt;/b&gt;  will be output as
 &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; Hello World &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; .  The XML   &gt; ,
which is escaped as  &amp;gt; , would be double-escaped as

The MIME type selected for the Inline XBRL Document will often have an impact
on whether browsers display the document correctly.  The MIME type can be set
within the Inline XBRL Document with code such as:  &lt;meta
content='text/html; charset=utf-8' http-equiv='Content-Type' /&gt; .

        </p>
            <p>

It should also be noted that browsers may also depend upon the filename suffix
in order to determine display behaviour.

        </p>
            <div class="nonNormativeExample">

Authors of Inline XBRL Documents should test how their documents display in
different browsers to ensure that the MIME type is set appropriately.

            <h2>7.2 Namespace declarations</h2>
            <p>

The display of Inline XBRL documents in different browsers is, regrettably,
sometimes dependent upon the location of the <span class="term">namespace</span> declarations in the
document.  In particular, placing the XHTML <span class="term">namespace</span> declaration
(<code>xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"</code>) anywhere in the body
of the Inline XBRL document is likely to lead to undefined treatment in many
browsers.

        </p>
            <div class="nonNormativeExample">
        
It is advisable to define the XHTML <span class="term">namespace</span> as the default in the root
<code>HTML</code>&nbsp;<span class="term">element</span> and nowhere else.

        </div>
         </div>
         <div class="div2"><a name="d1e1105" id="d1e1105"></a>
            <h2>7.3 Page breaks</h2>
            <p>

Inline XBRL supports page breaks in printed output.

        </p>
            <div class="nonNormativeExample">
        
Include the markup <code>&lt;p style="page-break-before: always" /&gt;</code> to
force a page break when the document is printed from most common browsers.

        </div>
         </div>
         <div class="div2"><a name="d1e1120" id="d1e1120"></a>
            <h2>7.4 QNames in attributes</h2>
            <p>

In Inline XBRL, the name of the XBRL element type in the Target Document is
determined by the value of the relevant
<code>name</code>&nbsp;<span class="term">attribute</span> in the Inline XBRL Document.  The
<code>name</code>&nbsp;<span class="term">attribute</span> is a <span class="term">QName</span>, that is,
it is in the form <span class="term">namespace prefix</span>:<span class="term">local name</span>.

        </p>
            <p>

So that the <span class="term">namespace prefix</span> can be expanded to the underlying
<span class="term">namespace name</span>, it is essential to make sure that all
<code>name</code>&nbsp;<span class="term">attributes</span> fall within the scope of the
appropriate <span class="term">namespace</span> declaration.

        </p>
            <p>

There is a general rule (Section 3.3.2 of the <a href="#IXBRL-PART1">[Inline XBRL Specification]</a>)
which requires that <span class="term">namespaces</span> are handled in accordance with the
namespaces specification, which is interpreted by Processors as requiring these
declarations to be made available within the Target Document.

        </p>
            <p>

Note that it should not be necessary to provide a <span class="term">namespace</span> declaration for
every  <code>name</code>&nbsp;<span class="term">attribute</span>.  As long as there is an
appropriate <span class="term">namespace</span> declaration in scope for the <span class="term">attribute</span>, the
<code>QName</code> will be treated correctly in the Target Document.

        </p>
            <p>

Canonicalisation <a href="#C14N">[C14N]</a> of the Inline XBRL document, which will
remove similar <span class="term">namespace</span> declarations with an overlapping scope, will not have
any impact on the validity of the Target Document.

        </p>
            <div class="nonNormativeExample">
        
Remember to make sure that there is an appropriate <span class="term">namespace</span> declaration in
scope for all <code>QNames</code> which are used in the Inline XBRL Document.

        </div>
         </div>
         <div class="div2"><a name="d1e1218" id="d1e1218"></a>
            <h2>7.5 URIs in Markup elements</h2>
            <p>

Markup which is mapped to the target document (as is the case with Markup
Elements included in <code>ix:footnote</code> elements and some
<code>ix:nonNumeric</code> elements) may contain URIs.

        </p>
            <p>

In HTML and XHTML, URIs may be absolute or relative.  In the absence of any
alternative, relative URIs will be converted to absolute URIs by Processors
using contextual information (such as current document location).  This is
unattractive for Inline XBRL, where the Inline XBRL document may be part of an
electronic filing with no pre-determined location, and can lead to
unpredictable results.

        </p>
            <div class="nonNormativeExample">

Unless hyperlinking between parts of the IXDS, authors should either use
absolute URIs or they should provide a base URI by including the
<code>BASE</code> element in the <code>HEAD</code> element of the Inline XBRL
document.

        </div>
            <p>

This topic is covered more fully in section 12.4.1 of the <a href="#HTML">[HTML]</a>
specification.

            <h2>7.6 URIs in Inline XBRL Elements</h2>
            <p>
  
Inline XBRL Element URIs, like URIs in Markup Elements, need to be capable
of resolution to absolute URIs as part of the mapping process.  A common
example of this is the <code>xlink:href</code> attribute.

        </p>
            <p>

The resolution of relative URIs in Inline XBRL Elements is controlled by the
<code>xml:base</code> attribute.  

        </p>
            <div class="nonNormativeExample">
        
Authors should either use absolute URIs in Inline XBRL Elements or they should
use the <code>xml:base</code> attribute.

         <h1>8 Discussion of consuming applications</h1>
         <p>

In general, it has been assumed that Inline XBRL will be consumed by standalone
Processors that will convert the Inline XBRL into an XBRL instance document which
will then be passed on to another application for further analysis or storage.
However, some use cases suggest that embedded applications (for instance,
JavaScript executed by a browser) might also be used to process the Inline XBRL.

      </p>
         <div class="div2"><a name="d1e1283" id="d1e1283"></a>
            <h2>8.1 Hidden elements</h2>
            <p>

Some elements which are required in the XBRL are not expected to be
displayed.  For instance, a value may be repeated several times in an XBRL
instance document, each time as a different concept.  Where the convention is
only to display this value once, the other occurrences are not displayed in the
Markup.  Inline XBRL uses the convention that such values will be placed in the
<code>ix:hidden</code> element.

        </p>
            <p>

However, use of the hidden area opens the possibility that data which will in
due course be processed and validated may be deliberately hidden from view.  We
expect that applications consuming Inline XBRL for further processing will
search for tagged data which has not been displayed, to check that it is
properly placed in the hidden area.  Likewise, the consuming application would
provide users with a way to inspect data in the hidden area.

        </p>
         </div>
         <div class="div2"><a name="d1e1298" id="d1e1298"></a>
            <h2>8.2 DOM</h2>
            <p>

There is a general caution with respect to Inline XBRL for in-browser
processing.  Inline XBRL uses several XML <span class="term">namespaces</span> to provide for more
reliable data processing.  Within the browser, however, different browsers may
expose Inline XBRL Elements to the <a href="#DOM">[HTML DOM]</a> in different ways.  Web
designers looking to access Inline XBRL metadata should be careful to take this
into account.
