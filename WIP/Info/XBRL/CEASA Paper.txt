And so those two questions (what is the target and can that target be achieved) is different than the real thing which ails XBRL.

This issue will NEVER be solved by Inline XBRL nor by the Data Point Model as far as I can tell.  This issue can likewise be broken down into two parts: (a) do domains express enough metadata so that interchangeable models can be created and (b) does XBRL have enough expressive power verification capabilities to verify that good models are being created?

In my view, this is the REAL issue.  XBRL cannot capture enough of the semantics which are necessary in a global-standard way to build high-quality, interoperable financial information which can be effectively exchanged.

etc.

In other words, XBRL is not fit for purpose, right from the horses mouth!

"Still to come is a UML (Unified modeling language) representation and an RDF/RDFS/OWL (Semantic Web Technologies) representation." !!

= even CH acknowledges that XBRL (or iXBRL) is far from what is needed!

with a quote from the second one:

XBRL was the standard of tomorrow in 1999,” said Daniel Roberts, who served from 2005 to 2006 as chairman of the XBRL-US steering committee, a nonprofit group of companies formed to facilitate the adoption of the technology. “Now it simply adds to the cost burden of financial reporting,” he said.

and from a comment by Kevin Day:
In order for XBRL to take hold, there has to be value beyond public filings. The day when a small business using Quickbooks or Simply Accounting [djh: Sage 50?] can export their data in XBRL and submit it to a bank for a loan (as an example), XBRL will really take off.

Connecting big business (regulation) to Big Data: Columbia report shows the need for action

Solution: Improve quality... More (ancillary filings) not less. Expand the mandate! Make structured data the filing i.e. ditch the paper part. (As for the UK.) Legislate to force the pace. Mentions one available too CalcBench: http://www.calcbench.com/

"Certainly, it's way too soon to dub XBRL a failure or to predict its demise. But the window of opportunity won't be open forever, either. If regulators can't convince—or cudgel—filers to fix problems, investors and analysts could abandon XBRL forever, and search for their own ways to make financial data more interactive. In fact, Big Data, which allows structured and unstructured data to be analyzed on the whole, already offers lot of promise in this area."
