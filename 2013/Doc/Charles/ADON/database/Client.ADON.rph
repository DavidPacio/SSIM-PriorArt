FRS 20 'Share-Based Payment (IFRS 2)' requires the recognition of equity-settled share-based payments at fair value at the date of the grant and the recognition of liabilities for cash-settled share-based payments at the current fair value at each balance sheet date. Prior to the adoption of FRS 20, the company did not recognise the financial effect of share-based payments until such payments were settled.

In accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 20, the Standard has been applied retrospectively to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2006.

For year ended [date last end], the change in accounting policy has resulted in a net decrease in the profit for the year of [cdb.aps.6][sum @103A+@103B+@153A+@153B+@234A+@234B c3 text]. The balance sheet at [date last end] has been restated to reflect the recognition of a liability for share-based payments of [cdb.aps.6][sum @808A+@872A c3 text], a share options reserve of [cdb.aps.6][sum @989A c3 text] and an additional deferred tax asset of [cdb.aps.6]XXX

For the year ended [date this end] the change in accounting policy has resulted in a net charge to the profit and loss account of [cdb.aps.6][sum @103A+@103B+@153A+@153B+@234A+@234B c1 text]. At [date this end], the share options reserve amounted to [cdb.aps.6][sum @989A c1 text], the liability recognised for share-based payments amounted to [cdb.aps.6][sum @808A+@872A c1 text] and the related deferred tax asset amounted to [cdb.aps.6]XXX.

The adoption of FRS 21 has resulted in a change in accounting policy in respect of proposed equity dividends.  If the company declares dividends to the holders of equity instruments after the balance sheet date, the company does not recognise those dividends as a liability at the balance sheet date.  The aggregate amount of equity dividends
proposed before approval of the financial statements, which have not been shown as liabilities at the balance sheet date, are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. Previously, proposed equity dividends were recorded as liabilities at the balance sheet date.

This change in accounting policy has resulted in a prior year adjustment for the company. Shareholders' funds at [date last begin] have been increased by [cdb.aps.6]XXX. For year ended [date last end], the change in accounting policy has resulted in a net increase in retained profit for the year of [cdb.aps.6]XXX. The balance sheet at [date last end] has been
restated to reflect the de-recognition of a liability for proposed equity dividends of [cdb.aps.6]XXX. For year ended [date this end], the change in accounting policy has resulted in a net increase in retained profit for the year of [cdb.aps.6]XXX.

//If the company operates both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes please amend the text below accordingly.
The company operates a defined benefit pension scheme for employees. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the company.

Current service costs, past service costs and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are charged to the profit and loss account. Past service costs are recognised over the vesting period or immediately if the benefits have vested. When a settlement (eliminating all obligations for benefits already accrued) or a curtailment [nonl]
(reducing future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the scheme membership or a reduction in future entitlement) occurs, the obligation and related plan assets are re-measured using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account during the period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.

[flush block]
The interest cost and the expected return on assets are shown as a net amount in the profit and loss account as other finance costs or income. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.

[flush block]
Pension scheme assets are valued at fair value at the balance sheet date.  Fair value is based on market price information and in the case of quoted securities is the published bid price.  Pension scheme liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit method and are discounted to their present value using a rate equivalent to the [nonl]
current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the scheme liabilities. Pension scheme (either: "surpluses (to the extent that they can be recovered) OR "deficits") are recognised in full on the balance sheet, net of related deferred tax.

The company issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees (including directors). Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, together with a corresponding increase in equity, based upon the company's estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
[end block]

[def block]
Fair value is measured using the [ShareOptionsPricingModelH]. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management's best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
[end block]

[def block]
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of modification.
[end block]

[def block]
Where an equity-settled transaction is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of the cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the transaction is recognised immediately. However, if a new transaction is substituted for the cancelled transaction, and designated as a replacement transaction on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new transactions are treated as if they were a modification of the original transaction,
as described in the previous paragraph.
[end block]

[def block]
For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability equal to the portion of the goods and services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each balance sheet date.

Financial instruments are classified and accounted for, according to the substance of the contractual arrangement, as either financial assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities.
[flush block][end block]

[def block]
[e77]Investments[e]

All investments are initially recorded at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including acquisition costs associated with the investment. All purchases and sales of investments are recognised using trade date accounting.
[flush block][end block]

[def block]
After initial recognition, investments, which are classified as held for trading and available-for-sale, are measured at fair value. Gains or losses on investments held for trading are recognised in the profit and loss account. Gains or losses on available-for-sale investments are recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is disposed of or [nonl]
until its value is impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the profit and loss account.
[flush block][end block]

[def block]
Investments classified as held-to-maturity are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in the profit and loss account when the investment in derecognised, or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
[flush block][end block]

[def block]
Investments are fair valued using quoted market prices, independent appraisals, discounted cash flow analysis or other appropriate valuation models at the balance sheet date.

[e77]Trade and other debtors[e]

Trade and other debtors are recognised and carried forward at invoices amounts less provisions for any doubtful debts. Bad debts are written off when identified.
[flush block][end block]

[def block]
[e77]Interest-bearing loans and borrowings[e]

All loans and borrowings are recognised initially at cost, which is the fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains or losses are recognised in the profit and loss account when liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
[flush block][end block]

[def block]
[e77]Derivative financial instruments[e]

The company uses a number of derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with interest rate and currency fluctuation risk. Such derivative financial instruments are always stated at their fair value.

For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting (see below), any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the profit and loss account.

Embedded derivatives are separated from their host contract and are recorded immediately in the profit and loss account when their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to the host contract and the hybrid instrument itself is not measured at fair value.
[flush block][end block]

[def block]
[e77]Hedging[e]

The company designates certain risks being hedged into three types:

- fair value hedges;

- cash flow hedges; and

- hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity.

In relation to fair value hedges, which meet the conditions for special hedge accounting, any gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
[flush block][end block]

[def block]
In relation to cash flow hedges, designed to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows relating to firm commitments or highly probable forecasted transactions, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument, which meets the conditions for special hedge [nonl]
accounting, is recognised directly in equity. Deferred gains and losses are released to the profit and loss account when the forecasted transactions occur.

An ineffective portion of the hedge is always recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
[flush block][end block]

[def block]
The hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity is accounted for as a cash flow hedge with foreign exchange differences recognised directly in equity.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the [nonl]
forecasted transaction occurs. If a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the profit and loss account.

[e2]***Reportpad FinancialinstrumPol should be tailored for specific circumstances***[e]

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all of its financial liabilities.

Where the contractual obligations of financial instruments (including share capital) are equivalent to a similar debt instrument, those financial instruments are classed as financial liabilities. Financial
liabilities are presented as such in the balance sheet.  Finance costs and gains or losses relating to financial liabilities are included in the profit and loss account. Finance costs are calculated so as to produce a constant rate of return on the outstanding liability.

Where the contractual terms of share capital do not have any terms meeting the definition of a financial liability then this is classed as an equity instrument. Dividends and distributions relating to equity instruments are debited direct to equity.
[flush block][end block]

[def block]
*** The following text should be included if there are any compound instruments****
[e77]Compound instruments[e]

Compound instruments comprise both a liability and an equity component. At date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for a similar debt instrument. The liability component is accounted for as a financial liability.

The residual is the difference between the net proceeds of issue and the liability component (at time of issue). The residual is the equity component, which is accounted for as an equity instrument.

The interest expense on the liability component is calculated applying the effective interest rate for the liability component of the instrument. The difference between this amount and any repayments is added to the carrying amount of the liability in the balance sheet.

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the company's share price over the previous … years. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the management's best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

[NoteTabP][caps off]USER DEFINED HEADING[e]

This gives an example of how reportpads can be used for more sophisticated entries.
In fact you can create "formats" inside reportpads.

To try this reportpad out, copy it into one of the spare notes such as the first spare
balance sheet note (spareB01).

[e2]This is a text heading[HeadingCol1S c2][HeadingCol2S c4][e]
[e4]This is a short subheading[e][NoteSubHeadingP]
[e2]Or you could put a heading here[e]
Sales [sum 1:49 c2,c4]
Cost of Sales [sum 50:199 c2,c4]
Expenses [sum 200:499 c2,c4]
Total [total c2,c4 aul,bdul]

Note that the figures will be correctly aligned with the rest of the reports, and will
even take on the style assigned for the accounts, e.g. bold for current year figures.

[e2]This is a text heading[HeadingCol1S c2][HeadingCol2S c4][e]
[e4]This is a short subheading[e][NoteSubHeadingP]
[e2]Or you could put a heading here[e]
Line one of figures entered directly [sum 100000 c2][sum -250000 c4]
Line two of figures entered directly [sum 900000 c2][sum 350000 c4]
Line three of figures entered directly [sum 1000000 c2][sum 1250000 c4]
Total of above [total c2,c4 aul,bdul]

The above example show that numbers can be directly entered into columns. This is useful
where the values do not come from the nominal ledger or any other part of the accounts.

Note that the numbers have to be entered as if pence values. e.g. to get [$]1 enter
100.

Values from the nominal ledger can appear in a paragraph by adding the command
"text" within the column command. For example this is the value of all credit
balances on accounts from 700 to 800 this year [sumc 700:800 c1 text] (last year -
[sumc 700:800 c3 text].

So here we have a reportpad note which contains a couple of paragraphs of text,
a table and a reference to some nominal balances in the text.

You have to be careful about starting a command such as {sumc 700:800 c1 text}
and splitting it at the end of the line. It thinks you have not completed the
closing brackets.

For further details see the Balance Sheet on page[pages B,b]. Note that it can even
look into the reports to find out on which page(s) the Balance Sheet appeared.
