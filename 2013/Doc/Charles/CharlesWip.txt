Questions
---------

1. In starting to set up the three types of StartEnd Instants, I added a check to Bros Import for the members of the Start/End Sum Lists being of Duration period.

   3019 with a list of 136 failed this as 136 is of Instant period.

   222 with a list of 222 (tuples) failed also.

   Is 3019 with 136 Instant OK? i.e. should I remove this check and allow Instants in SE sum lists?

   Or?

   (222 is a special case that I have to handle differently from other sums anyway.)

2. Start sum always zero?
