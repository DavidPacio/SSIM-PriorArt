ToDo
====

Properties/Property Items
* P1. Replace Assoc, JV, Subsid, Quasi by Superior and Subordinate but keep TPA.

* P2. Make the # (the EntityRef) for a Superior or Subordinate equal the Braiins ERef for that Entity so that an Entity can reference its Superior/Subordinates within the Braiins environment. Then all other attributes and properties could come from the other entity in the DB, and name etc changes would flow through. Thus for consolidation all group data would be available. (I.e. an Agent putting a Group through Braiins would 'have' to create entities for all subsidiaries, but surely that is legit.)

  Allowance for not yet created entities will have to be made to avoid a catch 22 situation during entity creation.

* P3. Remove the following Entity Property Items and instead access data in the Entities DB table for them all, accessed via the ERef as above.
  • FullName
  • ShortName
  • Descr
  • Taxonomy
  • Type
  • RegistrationNum

  To do this it will be necessary to add any missing ones to the Entities record and add an In-BroSet column for mapping Entity data where applicable - point B1 below.

* P4. Remove Property Item Group (ItemId 8) as this is handled by P5:

* P5. Add mux properties to Superior (as used by a Subordinate) for:
  • Controlling Party
  • Ultimate Parent (Group)
  • Immediate Parent (Group)

  (Not as an enum as initially proposed as explained in P12 below.)

* P6. Add properties to Subordinate (as used by a Superior) for:
  Mux Type:
  • Associate
  • Joint Venture
  • Other Participating Interest
  • Subsidiary
  Mux BasisDominantInfluence:
  • Majority share holding
  • Major common shareholder
  • Special Purpose Entity

* P7.  Remove Property Item PercentOwned (ItemId 12) as this info is held in 'PercentageHeld' Bros corresponding to your rows 25-27 (PercentageHeld, PercentageHeldByIndirectHoldings, PercentageHeldByDirectHoldings).

* P8. Allow an Entity to have multiple Superiors as well as multiple Subordinates

* P9. Add a Property Items option 'Allow use with Bro without any data'.
  This idea was sparked by BasisDominantInfluence. I considered making that a Bro enum (DataType) but decided to go for the Property Item as above. However, it is quite possible that a Bro for BasisDominantInfluence which is a string in UK-GAAP would be fully covered by the property, with no actual words posted. In that case the property item label would provide the words for a report.

  This option may prove useful for other Bro/Property Item combinations too.

  ** Use 'String' option instead? Might be apllicable to Registered Office Address as one string too.

* P10. Add a caption for groupings within properties. (Small blank lines in SS, thicker border in Property Items listing.)
       Added as Name and Label with Name to be used for P9 purposes.

* P11. Remove the following Person Property Items and instead access data in the People DB table for them all, accessed via the PersonRef:
  • FamilyName
  • GivenNames
  • Salutation
  • Position
  • Descr
  • FamilyNameFirst
  • FamilyNameLast
  • Female
  • Male

* P12. Remove the DataType column from property Items as all non-property data would be getting stored in the Braiins Entity and People DB tables = better. This is why I switched from an enum to properties for holding the Superior/Subordinate type info.

* P13. Update the Property Items notes! [Partly]

  Bros
* B1. Add an In-BroSet column for mapping Entity or People data where applicable e.g. Entity.FullName for the Name Bro, which could not be posted to. This avoids a problem we had before where the Entity name was stored in 2 places, the Entity record and via Bros. The RG issued a warning if they were different but used the Bro name.

* B2. Add an In-BroSet column for a Superior/Subordinate 'Applies to' list applicable if the Property Superior/Subordinate is allowed for the Bro, and the Bro is not mapped to Entity or People data as per B1 above.

  Values as per your SS:
  C,UP,IP: Posting allowable in a Subordinate for its Superior(s). (Not in the Superiors themselves.)
  A,J,O,S: Posting allowable in a Superior for its Subordinates. (Not in the Subordinates themselves.)

  Re Q2 and if c (both) is correct, then the RG or any other built-in report would need to:
  In Superior for C,UP,IP info access the data from its Subordinates.
  In Subordinate for A,J,O,S info access the data from its Superiors

  If the answer to Q4 is 'Yes' rather than 'No' then the allowable values for this extra Bro column would need to have a second attribute to specify whether for this Bro the data applies to the alternate (Superior/Subordinate) entity or not.

  Entities
* E1. Add fields to the current Entities record for items removed in P3 that aren't there already.
  • FullName
  • ShortName
  • Trading Name
  • Former Name
  • Date when ceased to be
  • Descr
  • Taxonomy
  • Type
  • RegistrationNum
  • Tax Number
  
  E2. Add provision for Entities which are not clients of the Agent, and for them to be:
  •  Created
  •  Edited
  •  Converted to client status

  People
* O1. Add fields to the current People record for items removed in P11 that aren't there already.
  • FamilyName
  • GivenNames
  • Salutation
  • Position
  • Descr
  • FamilyNameFirst
  • FamilyNameLast
  • Female
  • Male

* O2. Add a 'Ref' code to the People table. (Currently the only key is the email, but that wouldn't be a good key to use with properties.)

  O3. Add provision for People who are not members of the Agent, and for them to be:
  •  Created
  •  Edited
  •  Converted to member status

* A1. Add Addresses
  Address line 1
  Address line 2
  Address line 3
  City or Town
  Region, State, Province or County
  Post or Zip Code
  Country
  Description or other information about address

Add building of Entity stuff to BuildBrlStructs

Add mapping of ItemIds re Ei Items and Property classes

Mapping
-------
In-BroRef -> Out-BroRef

Factors
- Folio
- Props
- Items
  MType Items
- Tuples
- Concrete Eles
- ManDims
- ItemsDiMes


Questions
---------
Allow some Property Object Items to be used in accounting posting BroRefs e.g.

PublicRelations
  InvestorRelations
  MediaRelations
SalesMarketing
  Sales
  Marketing

Any properties for Quasi?

SIC 12 Special purpose entities

To Decide
---------
How to handle Tuples

We will need some mechanism in In-BroSets to handle different instances of the same BroRef where that is appropriate e.g. donations to political parties A, B, C, where that 'mechanism' gets mapped to tuples and tuple instances in the Tx area.

This will be an example of where 'properties all the way' will work well, I think.

We could perhaps have a Property called Instances whose Items are dynamic and = the instance# or reference entered in posting.

Once we allow for dynamic Property Items we could use them for other things too e.g. Director "instances" and so remove arbitrary limits like the 40 Directors in UK-GAAP. Though we would still need to cope with such limits when mapping BRL Properties to Taxonomy Dimensions.

To be thought about...

Points/Questions to Charles

- Group -> 1
  Why needed at all?

- Consol as an example of Ei reduction
  No 'Other'

  BizSegs also

- 27 Subsids - quasi

- K unque not within type

- What does 'of this type' mean re PensionSchemes?
