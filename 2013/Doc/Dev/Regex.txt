Eleven characters with special meanings: the opening square bracket [, the backslash \, the caret ^, the dollar sign $, the period or dot ., the vertical bar or pipe symbol |, the question mark ?, the asterisk or star *, the plus sign +, the opening round bracket ( and the closing round bracket ). These special characters are often called "metacharacters".

Text Patterns and Matches
-------------------------
A regular expression, or regex for short, is a pattern describing a certain amount of text. On this website, regular expressions are highlighted in red as 'regex'.

This first example is actually a perfectly valid regex. It is the most basic pattern, simply matching the literal text regex. Matches are highlighted in blue on this site.

I will use the term "string" to indicate the text that I am applying the regular expression to. I will highlight them in green.

Literal Characters
------------------
The most basic regular expression consists of a single literal character, e.g.: a. It will match the first occurrence of that character in the string. If the string is Jack is a boy, it will match the a after the J.

This regex can match the second a too. It will only do so when you tell the regex engine to start searching through the string after the first match. In a text editor, you can do so by using its "Find Next" or "Search Forward" function. In a programming language, there is usually a separate function that you can call to continue searching through the string after the previous match.

Eleven characters with special meanings: the opening square bracket [, the backslash \, the caret ^, the dollar sign $, the period or dot ., the vertical bar or pipe symbol |, the question mark ?, the asterisk or star *, the plus sign +, the opening round bracket ( and the closing round bracket ). These special characters are often called "metacharacters".

[ \ ^ $ . | ? * + ( )

If you want to use any of these characters as a literal in a regex, you need to escape them with a backslash. If you want to match 1+1=2, the correct regex is 1\+1=2. Otherwise, the plus sign will have a special meaning.

Learn more about literal characters http://www.regular-expressions.info/characters.html

Character Classes or Character Sets
-----------------------------------
A "character class" matches only one out of several characters. To match an a or an e, use [ae]. You could use this in gr[ae]y to match either gray or grey. A character class matches only a single character. gr[ae]y will not match graay, graey or any such thing. The order of the characters inside a character class does not matter.

You can use a hyphen inside a character class to specify a range of characters. [0-9] matches a single digit between 0 and 9. You can use more than one range. [0-9a-fA-F] matches a single hexadecimal digit, case insensitively. You can combine ranges and single characters. [0-9a-fxA-FX] matches a hexadecimal digit or the letter X.

Typing a caret after the opening square bracket will negate the character class. The result is that the character class will match any character that is not in the character class. q[^x] matches qu in question. It does not match Iraq since there is no character after the q for the negated character class to match.

Learn more about character classes http://www.regular-expressions.info/charclass.html

Shorthand Character Classes
---------------------------
\d matches a single character that is a digit, \w matches a "word character" (alphanumeric characters plus underscore), and \s matches a whitespace character (includes tabs and line breaks). The actual characters matched by the shorthands depends on the software you're using. Usually, non-English letters and numbers are included.

Learn more about shorthand character classes http://www.regular-expressions.info/charclass.html#shorthand

\d = [0-9]
\w = [A-Za-z0-9_] (usually)
\s = whitespace character
also \t \n \r

Capital letter are Negated Shorthand Character Classes
\D is [^\d] or [^0-9]
\W = [^\w]
\S = [^\s]

thus [\s\S] matches any character without line feed issues as for .

Non-Printable Characters
------------------------
You can use special character sequences to put non-printable characters in your regular expression. Use \t to match a tab character (ASCII 0x09), \r for carriage return (0x0D) and \n for line feed (0x0A). More exotic non-printables are \a (bell, 0x07), \e (escape, 0x1B), \f (form feed, 0x0C) and \v (vertical tab, 0x0B). Remember that Windows text files use \r\n to terminate lines, while UNIX text files use \n.

Use \xFF to match a specific character by its hexadecimal index in the character set. E.g. \xA9 matches the copyright symbol in the Latin-1 character set.

If your regular expression engine supports Unicode, use \uFFFF to insert a Unicode character. E.g. \u20AC matches the euro currency sign.

All non-printable characters can be used directly in the regular expression, or as part of a character class.

Learn more about non-printable characters http://www.regular-expressions.info/charclass.html#nonprint

The Dot Matches (Almost) Any Character
--------------------------------------
The dot matches a single character, except line break characters. It is short for [^\n] (UNIX regex flavors) or [^\r\n] (Windows regex flavors). Most regex engines have a "dot matches all" or "single line" mode that makes the dot match any single character, including line breaks.

gr.y matches gray, grey, gr%y, etc. Use the dot sparingly. Often, a character class or negated character class is faster and more precise.

Learn more about the dot http://www.regular-expressions.info/dot.html
From that page:
JavaScript and VBScript do not have an option to make the dot match line break characters. In those languages, you can use a character class such as [\s\S] to match any character. This character matches a character that is either a whitespace character (including line break characters), or a character that is not a whitespace character. Since all characters are either whitespace or non-whitespace, this character class matches any character.

Anchors
-------
Anchors do not match any characters. They match a position.

^ matches at the start of the string
$ matches at the end of the string.
Most regex engines have a "multi-line" mode that makes ^ match after any line break, and $ before any line break. E.g. ^b matches only the first b in bob.

\b matches at a word boundary. A word boundary is a position between a character that can be matched by \w and a character that cannot be matched by \w. \b also matches at the start and/or end of the string if the first and/or last characters in the string are word characters.

\B matches at every position where \b cannot match.

Learn more about anchors http://www.regular-expressions.info/anchors.html

Alternation
-----------
Alternation is the regular expression equivalent of "or". cat|dog will match cat in About cats and dogs. If the regex is applied again, it will match dog. You can add as many alternatives as you want, e.g.: cat|dog|mouse|fish.

Learn more about alternation http://www.regular-expressions.info/alternation.html

From thast page:
The alternation operator has the lowest precedence of all regex operators. 

Remember That The Regex Engine Is Eager
I already explained that the regex engine is eager. It will stop searching as soon as it finds a valid match. The consequence is that in certain situations, the order of the alternatives matters. Suppose you want to use a regex to match a list of function names in a programming language: Get, GetValue, Set or SetValue. The obvious solution is Get|GetValue|Set|SetValue. Let's see how this works out when the string is SetValue.

The regex engine starts at the first token in the regex, G, and at the first character in the string, S. The match fails. However, the regex engine studied the entire regular expression before starting. So it knows that this regular expression uses alternation, and that the entire regex has not failed yet. So it continues with the second option, being the second G in the regex. The match fails again. The next token is the first S in the regex. The match succeeds, and the engine continues with the next character in the string, as well as the next token in the regex. The next token in the regex is the e after the S that just successfully matched. e matches e. The next token, t matches t.

At this point, the third option in the alternation has been successfully matched. Because the regex engine is eager, it considers the entire alternation to have been successfully matched as soon as one of the options has. In this example, there are no other tokens in the regex outside the alternation, so the entire regex has successfully matched Set in SetValue.

Contrary to what we intended, the regex did not match the entire string. There are several solutions. One option is to take into account that the regex engine is eager, and change the order of the options. If we use GetValue|Get|SetValue|Set, SetValue will be attempted before Set, and the engine will match the entire string. We could also combine the four options into two and use the question mark to make part of them optional: Get(Value)?|Set(Value)?. Because the question mark is greedy, SetValue will be attempted before Set.

The best option is probably to express the fact that we only want to match complete words. We do not want to match Set or SetValue if the string is SetValueFunction. So the solution is \b(Get|GetValue|Set|SetValue)\b or \b(Get(Value)?|Set(Value)?)\b. Since all options have the same end, we can optimize this further to \b(Get|Set)(Value)?\b 

Repetition
----------
? = prec tok 0 or 1 times i.e. optional
* = prec tok 0 or more times   + ? to make it lazy
+ = prec tok 1 or more times   + ? to make it lazy
 
The question mark makes the preceding token in the regular expression optional. E.g.: colou?r matches colour or color.

The asterisk or star tells the engine to attempt to match the preceding token zero or more times. The plus tells the engine to attempt to match the preceding token once or more. <[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*> matches an HTML tag without any attributes. <[A-Za-z0-9]+> is easier to write but matches invalid tags such as <1>.

Use curly braces to specify a specific amount of repetition. Use \b[1-9][0-9]{3}\b to match a number between 1000 and 9999. \b[1-9][0-9]{2,4}\b matches a number between 100 and 99999.

Learn more about quantifiers  http://www.regular-expressions.info/repeat.html

Greedy and Lazy Repetition
--------------------------
The repetition operators or quantifiers are greedy. They will expand the match as far as they can, and only give back if they must to satisfy the remainder of the regex. The regex <.+> will match <EM>first</EM> in This is a <EM>first</EM> test.

Place a question mark after the quantifier to make it lazy. <.+?> will match <EM> in the above string.

A better solution is to follow my advice to use the dot sparingly. Use <[^<>]+> to quickly match an HTML tag without regard to attributes. The negated character class is more specific than the dot, which helps the regex engine find matches quickly.

Learn more about greedy and lazy quantifiers http://www.regular-expressions.info/repeat.html#greedy

From that ref
Negated char class with greey + can be better e.g. <[^>]+> also matches <EM>

Grouping and Backreferences
---------------------------
Place round brackets around multiple tokens to group them together. You can then apply a quantifier to the group. E.g. Set(Value)? matches Set or SetValue.

Round brackets create a capturing group. The above example has one group. After the match, group number one will contain nothing if Set was matched or Value if SetValue was matched. How to access the group's contents depends on the software or programming language you're using. Group zero always contains the entire regex match.

Use the special syntax Set(?:Value)? to group tokens without creating a capturing group.
This is more efficient if you don't plan to use the group's contents. Do not confuse the question mark in the non-capturing group syntax with the quantifier.

(?: = non-capturing group
(?> = atomic group http://www.regular-expressions.info/atomic.html
(?= = lookahead as below
(?! = negative lookahead
(?<= = lookback
(?<! = negative lookback
 
Learn more about grouping and backreferences http://www.regular-expressions.info/brackets.html
From that ref:
Round Brackets Create a Backreference
Backreferences allow you to reuse part of the regex match. You can reuse it inside the regular expression (see below), or afterwards.

Using Backreferences in The Regular Expression

Backreferences can not only be used after a match has been found, but also during the match. Suppose you want to match a pair of opening and closing HTML tags, and the text in between. By putting the opening tag into a backreference, we can reuse the name of the tag for the closing tag. Here's how: <([A-Z][A-Z0-9]*)\b[^>]*>.*?</\1> . This regex contains only one pair of parentheses, which capture the string matched by [A-Z][A-Z0-9]* into the first backreference. This backreference is reused with \1 (backslash one). The / before it is simply the forward slash in the closing HTML tag that we are trying to match.

To figure out the number of a particular backreference, scan the regular expression from left to right and count the opening round brackets. The first bracket starts backreference number one, the second number two, etc. Non-capturing parentheses are not counted. This fact means that non-capturing parentheses have another benefit: you can insert them into a regular expression without changing the numbers assigned to the backreferences. This can be very useful when modifying a complex regular expression.

You can reuse the same backreference more than once. ([a-c])x\1x\1 will match axaxa, bxbxb and cxcxc.

Useful Example: Checking for Doubled Words

When editing text, doubled words such as "the the" easily creep in. Using the regex \b(\w+)\s+\1\b Analyze this regular expression with RegexBuddy in your text editor, you can easily find them. To delete the second word, simply type in \1 as the replacement text and click the Replace button.

Unicode Properties
------------------
\p{L} matches a single character that has a given Unicode property. L stands for letter. \P{L} matches a single character that does not have the given Unicode property. You can find a complete list of Unicode properties in the tutorial.

Learn more about Unicode regular expressions http://www.regular-expressions.info/unicode.html

Lookaround
----------
Lookaround is a special kind of group. The tokens inside the group are matched normally, but then the regex engine makes the group give up its match and keeps only the result. Lookaround matches a position, just like anchors. It does not expand the regex match.

q(?=u) matches the q in question, but not in Iraq. This is positive lookahead. The u is not part of the overall regex match. The lookahead matches at each position in the string before a u.

q(?!u) matches q in Iraq but not in question. This is negative lookahead. The tokens inside the lookahead are attempted, their match is discarded, and the result is inverted.

To look backwards, use lookbehind. (?<=a)b matches the b in abc. This is positive lookbehind. (?<!a)b fails to match abc.

You can use a full-fledged regular expression inside the lookahead. Most regular expression engines only allow literal characters and alternation inside lookbehind, since they cannot apply regular expression backwards.

Removing white space
--------------------
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/360491/how-do-i-strip-white-space-when-grabbing-text-with-jquery

Use the replace function in js:

var emailAdd = $(this).text().replace(/ /g,'');

That will remove all the spaces

If you want to remove the leading and trailing whitespace only, use the jQuery $.trim method :
var emailAdd = $.trim($(this).text());

Correct but /\s/g would be a clearer pattern (the "i" is redundant and the ' ' is an unusual form -
also fwiw a pattern of /(^\s*)|(\s*$)/g is equivalent to trim. – annakata Dec 18 '08 at 10:04
	
You are correct annakata, I removed the /i because it is redundant since case sensitivity in this case is not an issue – Andreas Grech Dec 23 '08 at 13:03
	
One thing to be wary of is that IE doesn't consider non-breaking spaces (&nbsp;, &#160;, &#xA0;, \xA0, \u00A0, etc...) as white-space, so /[\s\xA0]+/g might be more reliable for replacing all white-space. – travis Jan 27 '10 at 17:57

Php version as used in Clean:

      case FT_EMAIL:    $val = preg_replace('/\s*/m', '', $val); break; // remove all ws for FT_PW and FT_EMAIL
      case FT_STR:
      case FT_TEXTAREA: $val = trim(preg_replace('/\s\s+/m', ' ', $val)); break; // trim and reduce internal excess ws to a single space


Camel Case
----------
$camelCaseWords = preg_split('/(?<=\\w)(?=[A-Z,0-9])/', $sName); // digits too

Slight mod to the CamelCaseFormat regex that behaves better with strings with multiple upper case letters immediately following each other.

CustomerID -> Customer ID and not Customer I D

<?php
$test = 'CustomerIDWithSomeOtherJETWords';

preg_replace('/(?!^)[[:upper:]][[:lower:]]/', ' $0', preg_replace('/(?!^)[[:upper:]]+/', ' $0', $test));
?>
