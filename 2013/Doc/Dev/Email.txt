Context.IO is the missing email API that makes it easy and fast to integrate your user's email data in your application.

Context.IO is mentioned in the MailGun FAQs:
Can I get access data in my Mailboxes through an HTTP API?
We don’t have an HTTP API to access data in Mailboxes, but context.io has some great APIs for this.

But IMAP only?

Transactional only. Appears to be just for sending.

MailChimp helps you design email newsletters, share them on social networks, integrate with services you already use, and track your results. It's like your own personal publishing platform
