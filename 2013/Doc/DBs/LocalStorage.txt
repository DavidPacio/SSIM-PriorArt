=====================

History:

Local
=====
B   Braiins JS and localStorage version
t#  Time in secs for instance # of a Braiins.com main tab (not a separate tab app), updated every second via setInterval() for a live tab
v#  CVisId for instance #

Session
=======
i  Instance # of a Braiins.com main tab (not a separate tab app)
   Computed by js as # for which there is no localStorage t# or a t# not updated for > 5 seconds
v  CVisId for the tab


Notes
=====
How to allow multiple Braiins.com tabs without getting them mixed up?

FF remembers sessionStorage through a browser restart! (With auto re-load of tabs)
Chrome does not.

Use polling?
Use storage change event?


This doesn't work. Need to call removeItem() in a separate loop as it changes len
      var len=localStorage.length, k, now = new Date().getTime()
      for (i=0;i<len;i++) {
        k=localStorage.key(i)
        if (k.contains('Tab')) {
          if (now - localStorage[k] > 30000) {
           if (!Me)
             Me=k
           else
             localStorage.removeItem(k)
          }
        }else
          localStorage.removeItem(k)
