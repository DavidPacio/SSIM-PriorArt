• To Do Today started 13.10.13
  ===========

Eat more slowly - chew more.

I am responsible. Don't gossip - be positive about others.

Meditate a la Al Sears:
Here’s the technique I gave Todd that the Marines and Special Forces use, and you can use too. One thing to remember is that the benefits come from being mindful and focusing your concentration.
• Sit in a comfortable position, close your eyes.
• Let your awareness settle on the movement of your breath.
• Follow the in-breath and out-breath, perhaps by saying “breathing in, breathing out” quietly to yourself.
• Sit upright, with spine straightened and chin tucked in, while you calmly observe your breath.
• Do this for ten to fifteen minutes a day.

- Look at 14.02.07 03:02 and 04:22 where Up -> Flat then -> Up with the Up Flex overwriting the Flat. Need to cancel both the Flat and the new Up, staying with just the original Up
- Look at 14.02.13 03:19 which should continue the Up. Neither Can 14.02.13 03:20 nor 03:21 is enough the trigger the PossUp, but together they would i.e. need to consider MultiCans before as well as after a PossChange is in effect.
- Consider Flex_CanSigForFullUpDirnChange etc values for MultiCans either per MultiCan or per can incl in a MultiCan
• Consider using cumulative CanSig instead of counting passes with MultiCans [Yes. Trying this. In progress via CanTrend.mq4.]
