Dimension Handling
==================

The Dimension Handling Plan as of 20.06.11.

[See Braiins RG DB.txt and Constants.RG for the details of the actual implementation. Comment added 24.06.11 post implementation.]

(in addition to the already working dimensions mapping and packing/unpacking of BRO Idxs via PackBroIdx() and UnPackBroIdx())

Entity Type
===========
Define an Entity type enum to be set when the Entity is created, along with with other properties as per Charles' ideas
in his "Zones vs Hypercubes and Dimensions" email of 29 May 2011:

Example; if as part of the initial set up pages we know that there are no Restatements and or that this company is not
 the parent company of a group then conditions can be restricted/made illegal right at the outset.

In fact for some Dimensions it might be better not to control them within Zones at all, but make them Global in their inclusion or exclusion.
Language
Country
Restated
Group


Dimension Members (DiMe/DiMes)
=================
Provide for 4 types:
0 or N Normal i.e. standard, not an S, P, or X special DiMe

1 or S Set type for use in defining a 'dimension based set' e.g.
       Officers.CoSec, Officers.Director1-Director40, Officers.PartnerLLP1-PartnerLLP20, TPAType.Accountants-Receivers

2 or P Property type for use as a second DiMe with an S first DiMe e.g.
       Officers.Chairman (419), Officers.CEO (420), Officers.ChairmanCEO (421),
       Officers.ChiefPartnerLLP (422), Officers.CoSec (423),
       Officers.CoSecretaryDirector (424), Officers.HighestPaidDirector (425),
       OfficerType.Executive (487), OfficerType.Nonexecutive (488)

3 or X Not ever user selectable being reserved for Braiins RG generation e.g. Officers.AllEntityOfficers

Plus
- optional entity type list meaning only applicable to members of that list e.g. company or LLP

BROs
====
1. Change the current 'Must Have' dim to 'Set Dim', defined at the BRO Set level with an optional Element override either way
   i.e. -> Set Dim or no Set Dim
2. Add the option of a list of allowable DiMes for the 1st dim, defined at the BRO Set level with an optional Element override, for:
   - DimId and type S plus entity type match DiMes
   or
   - DiMes range plus entity type match e.g. CoSec & Director1-Director40, Director1-Director40, PartnerLLP1-PartnerLLP20
   plus optional
   - 'none ok' e.g. for Officers.DirectorRemuneration with 'none ok' being added to a money BRO by default
3. Add the option of a list of applicable DiMes for the 2nd dim if a 2nd dim is allowed,
   defined at the BRO element level (not needed by BRO Sets), for:
   - DimId and type P plus entity type match DiMes
   or
   - DiMes doubly dimensioned list by 1st dim range choice, plus entity type match e.g.
     CoSec -> none
     Director1-Director40 -> Officers.Chairman (419), Officers.CEO (420), Officers.ChairmanCEO (421),
                             Officers.CoSecretaryDirector (424), Officers.HighestPaidDirector (425),
                             OfficerType.Executive (487), OfficerType.Nonexecutive (488)
                             [Not Officers.AllEntityOfficers (418), Officers.ChiefPartnerLLP (422)
                              or Officers.CoSec (423)]
     with this list to be reduced according to choices already made to prevent duplicates.

Handling of HighestPaidDirector and AllEntityOfficers Contexts
--------------------------------------------------------------
For BROs with context of RGC_Officer (Officers but not Officers.Aggregates) and type Money:
- 'posting' with no dims allowable via BRO property of 'allowable 1st dim = 'none ok'
- summing algorithm to check if such a BRO has child dims and if so:
  * if a total (no dims) has been 'posted' check that the sum of the dim children = the total value
  * if a total (no dims) has not been 'posted', set it to the sum of the dim children
- if a child dim is output-> RGC_Officer context unless the dim is for the director who has the HighestPaidDirector property set,
                             in which case -> HighestPaidDirector context
- if the total (no dims) is output -> RGC_AllOfficers context, whether it has child dims or not

BROs with context of RGC_AllOfficers (Officers.Aggregates) -> RGC_AllOfficers context in all cases.

Zones
=====
All the above is to be subject to Zones override re allowable dimensions.

Will Need
=========
- DiMe ranges array and range 'Id' by entity type e.g.:
  All:     TPAType.Accountants-Receivers
  Company: CoSec & Director1-Director40 for SchInputEntity.Officers.Name and SchInputDirRep.DirectorSigningReport
           Director1-Director40               for SchInputEntity.Officers.DirectorSigningAccounts, Officers.DirectorRemuneration etc
  LLP:     PartnerLLP1-PartnerLLP20           for all Officers BROs?
