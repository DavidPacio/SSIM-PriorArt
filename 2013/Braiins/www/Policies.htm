<h1 class=c>Privacy and Security Policies</h1>

<p>We take your privacy and the security of your data seriously. The <a href='#PPP'>Privacy</a> and <a href='#PSP'>Security</a> Policies below for the Braiins.com site, owned and operated by <a href=About.htm title='About Us'>Braiins Ltd.</a>, spell out how we deliver on that promise.</p>

<p>But Braiins cannot do everything to maintain your privacy and keep your data secure. You have to help too. Please see <a href='#PYP'>Your Part</a> at the end.</p>

<p>These Policies and 'Your Part' form part of the Braiins <a href=ToS.htm title='Terms of Service'>Terms of Service</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions about these policies, and your part, please <a href=Contact.htm title='Contact Us'>Contact Us</a>.</p>

<h2><a name='PPP'></a>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Information entered by you, or collected about you, on the Braiins site, is confidential. At no time is any information held about you ever given, disclosed, sold or traded to any other group or individual, unless specifically requested by you, or unless to comply with applicable laws, a subpoena or other legal process.</p>

<p>You can edit (change) any information entered by you, at any time. Such changes take effect immediately. The history of such changes is kept for data recreation and potential dispute resolution purposes.</p>

<p>The precautions taken by Braiins to protect your information are described in <a href='#PSP'>Security Policy</a> below.</p>

<p>Specific aspects of some information storage and use by the Braiins site are:</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>In regard to email use, and your email address or addresses, Braiins specifically confirms:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will not be spammed by Braiins or any Braiins related entity, nor will your email address be passed on to any group or individual who might spam you.</li>
<li>You will be sent confirmation type emails but not be pestered with other emails.</li>
<li>If you subscribe to Braiins News, you will be emailed from time to time with new or significant items of Braiins News. You can unsubscribe at any time, via the Braiins site, or via the unsubscribe link included in every Braiins News email.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Credit Cards</h3>
<p>The Braiins site does not store any credit card information, not even momentarily.</p>

<p>Instead, we focus on Accounts Production and make use of a specialist online payments company, <a href='http://www.alertpay.com' target='_blank' title='AlertPay Inc'>AlertPay Inc</a>, to handle all payment processing tasks.</p>

<p>AlertPay is a Canadian Registered Corporation and a United States Registered Corporation and complies with the regulations of the OSFI (Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada), FINTRAC (Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada) and FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network).</p>

<p>AlertPay keeps your credit card data safe, and handles the transactions without ever revealing any of your credit card details to us.</p>

<h3>IP Address, Browser and Computer Information, Visit History</h3>
<p>The IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer you use to access the Braiins site; information about the browser, operating system, and monitor resolution; plus each action you take during a visit are recorded.</p>

<p>This information</p>
<ul>
<li>assists with security measures - suspicious activity can be tracked</li>
<li>allows the provision of geographic alternatives on the sites</li>
<li>helps in allocating affiliate scheme commissions if applicable</li>
<li>provides data for statistical analysis of traffic, trends, marketing results, and server loads</li>
<li>helps with site user interface design improvements</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A Cookie is a small computer file stored on your computer hard drive by your browser. The Braiins site uses cookies to allow you to be identified automatically when you return to the site, and as part of maintaining your identity (&ldquo;state&rdquo;) during a visit. The Braiins site will not function correctly if cookies are disabled in your browser settings.</p>

<p>Braiins cookies hold no personal information about you, just a coded session identifier, which, when used to identify logged in member activities, is also checked by other means for possible security infringement attempts.</p>

<p>Braiins cookies are updated on every visit, and last for one year.</p>

<p>If you Logout totally from Braiins, and the site include an option for you to do this, the cookie link to you is deleted. (A Braiins cookie remains on your computer but it does not link to you, just to a &ldquo;no name&rdquo; session.) If you access the Braiins site via a public computer e.g. at an Internet cafe, then it is recommended that you logout totally before leaving the computer.</p>

<p>You may also delete Braiins cookies via your browser if you should wish.</p>

<h3>Blog Comments</h3>
<p>Comments posted to the Braiins Blog are public i.e. they are not private to you, and on posting, ownership of the comment passes to Braiins, although any possible reuse of the comment will attribute it to you. Braiins may moderate (edit) or delete comments as it sees fit in order to remove offensive or inaccurate material.</p>

<h2><a name='PSP'></a>Security Policy</h2>
<p>Protecting your information to keep it from being accessed by unauthorized persons is a vital concern of Braiins both for your sake and ours. Nothing would destroy the reputation of Braiin faster than a security failure, so we take security very seriously. We hope that you will also.</p>

<p>Specifically:</p>

<h3>Password</h3>
<p>Braiins accounts are password protected, and also have a secondary security question associated with them.</p>

<p>The Braiins site software ensures that your email address and password are unique to you.</p>

<p>Passwords are stored encrypted in the Braiins database using what is called one way encryption. This means that the password cannot be retrieved in its original encrypted form. Thus, if you forget the password, we cannot tell you what it was, and can only issue you with a new temporary password after confirmation that you are entitled to be given one.</p>

<p>But you also must please do your part to ensure that your password and associated security question are effective in keeping your data safe, as listed in Your Part below.</p>

<h3>Encrypted Transmission</h3>
<p>All communication between your computer and our servers of private (member) data is encrypted using industry standard Transport Layer Security (TLS). See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer for more information about TLS and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).</p>

<p>TLS requires the server to confirm its identification via a digital certificate, which Braiins keeps up to date. If ever your browser should report a problem with a Braiins site certificate, you should not ignore the warning and continue.</p>

<h3>Hosting</h3>
<p>The Braiins site is hosted with <a href="http://www.rackspacecloud.com" title="Rackspace Cloud Hosting - Formerly Mosso">Rackspace Cloud Hosting</a> in the USA, managed from Braiins's offices.</p>

<p>Rackspace provides the following to enhance security for the Braiins site:</p>
<ul>
<li>Servers always up to date for security and other updates</li>
<li>Enterprise grade firewalls</li>
<li>Clustering for reliability</li>
<li>High levels of data canter physical security, system security, and operational security versus viruses, and other malware, <a href='http://www.rackspace.com/downloads/pdfs/RackspaceSecurityApproach.pdf' target='_blank'>detailed here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Sites Themselves</h3>
<p>The Braiins site has been developed with security in mind. Security starts with good design and programming.</p>

<p>No data received over the web by Braiins is used without checking to ensure that it is harmless.</p>

<p>Sessions for member activities are indentified by two methods which must match.</p>

<h3>Security Audits</h3>
<p>Braiins runs regular security audits of the site using external security checking systems, including those provided by <a href='http://www.securityspace.com/' target='_blank'>SecuritySpace</a> which test for over 16,000 vulnerabilities. Importantly, Braiins fixes anything uncovered by the external audits.</p>

<h3>No Physical Transport or Storage of Your Data</h3>
<p>Your data is never transported anywhere by physical means i.e. it is never copied to tape or DVD for transport by post or courier, and thus potential loss.</p>

<p>Instead, all Braiins data, stays within the secure Rackspace data center, or moves via an encrypted internet link to another secure data center for backup purposes. No physical offsite tape or DVD copies are kept.</p>

<h2><a name='PYP'></a>Your Part</h2>
<p>Braiins and the Braiins site cannot do everything to maintain your privacy and keep your data secure. You have to help too. Please:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take responsibility for any data that resides on your own computer or local network, as Braiins and the Braiins site have no control over that whatsoever.</li>
<li>Keep your personal information including email address accurate and up to date.</li>
<li>Choose a password that others won't be able to guess easily. Don't use your birthday, your pet's name, or any such easy to crack passwords.</li>
<li>For your security question and answer don't use something that people can guess or find out by Googling you.</li>
<li>Keep your password secure at all times, and don't let anyone watch you enter your password.</li>
<li>Change your password from time to time.</li>
<li>Change your password immediately if you become aware of any unauthorized use of it.</li>
<li>Logout totally after finishing a Braiins session on any public computer.</li>
<li>Stop immediately if your browser issues a warning about a Braiins site certificate, and do not override the warning.</li>
<li>Do not respond to any email which asks you for your Braiins password or other sensitive information. (No real Braiins email or staff member will ever ask you for such information.)</li>
<li>Keep your own computer(s) up to date with updates.</li>
<li>Run anti-virus software on your computer(s) and keep it up to date.</li>
